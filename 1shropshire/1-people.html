<h3>Humphrey Kynaston</h3>
<img class="imgc" src="assets/images/people/2023-07-28_13_10_07_DSC_0288.jpg">
<p>In the 16th Century, Nescliffe Hill became a rendezvous for highway robbers.  The wooded hill probably provided an excellent place from which to surprise travellers on the main Oswestry to Shrewsbury road.  The most famous of these highwaymen was the outlaw 'Wild Humphrey' Kynaston, who was outlawed for his part in the murder of a man at Little Stretton.  He is reputed to have lived in this cave.  Legend tells us that Humphrey Kynaston assumed the role of a Shropshire 'Robin Hood', robbing the rich and helping the poor.  He is said to have owned an impressive horse, capable of leaping over men, gates and on one occasion a gaping hole in the bridge over the River Severn at Montford.  Wild Humphrey was pardoned in 1516 and died peacefully in 1534.</p>
<p>The cave was lived in until at least the 18th Century when a family of nine was raised in what must have been very primitive conditions.</p>
<p>Nawadays the cave is a home for bats which breed and hibernate in deep crevices in the rocks.</p>

<h3>John Benbow</h3>

<p>John Benbow (10th March 1653 to 4th November 1702) joined the navy aged 25 years, seeing action against Algerian pirates before leaving and joining the merchant navy where he traded until the Glorious Revolution of 1688, whereupon he returned to the Royal Navy and was commissioned. Benbow fought against France during the Nine Years War, serving on and later commanding several vessels. He went on to achieve fame during campaigns against pirates and fighting in the West Indies against France during the War of the Spanish Succession.</p>
<p>Benbow's fame and success earned him both public notoriety and a promotion to admiral.  He was then involved in an incident during the action of August 1702, where a number of his captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did not live to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture, including Treasure Island - the Admiral Benbow is the tavern where Jim Hawkins and his mother live.</p>
