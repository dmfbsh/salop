<h3>John (Mad Jack) Myttons Ghost</h3>
<img class="imgc" src="assets/images/folklore/2020-03-01_13_36_56_DSC_6582.jpg">
<p>John 'Mad Jack' Mytton was a Regency eccentric (born and buried in Shropshire) - he inherited a fortune, but died in a debtor's prison at the age of 38.  His many pranks made him a legend, it was said that his life amounted to a series of suicide attempts.</p>
<p>His ghost is said to appear annually on Mytton's birthday, September 30th, at the Mytton &amp; Mermaid Hotel at Atcham as his funeral procession stopped at the Mytton, then a coaching inn, on the way to Halston Chapel where he is buried.</p>

<h3>Mitchells Fold</h3>
<img class="imgc" src="assets/images/folklore/2018-02-24_14_57_22_DSC_2137.jpg">
<p>The story of the Dun Cow is associated with Mitchell's Fold, in that according to traditional folklore Mitchell's Fold is where a giant kept a cow which gave unlimited amounts of milk. One day a witch milked the cow using a sieve until it had no more milk, as a result the cow fled to Warwickshire where it  became the Dun Cow. The witch was turned to stone and surrounded by other stones to prevent escape.</p>
<p>Local folklore also suggests that Mitchell's Fold is the place where Arthur withdrew Excalibur from one of the stones.</p>

<h3>St Milburgas Well (Much Wenlock)</h3>
<img class="imgc" src="assets/images/folklore/2022-04-16_15_15_48_DSC_1111.jpg">
<p>There are two locations in Much Wenlock attributed as the site of St Milburga's Well, an ancient spring possessed with healing properties, and the ability to help young women find out whom their husband would be.</p>
<p>The first site is off Barrow Street, near the Guildhall.  The other site is further to the south east on Barrow Street, near the bottom left of St Miburga Row, and is marked as 'Whymperis Well'.</p>
<p>In 1913, all the wells were drained into the sewers.  Long term flooding problems in the town necessitated this action. The town sits within a bowl, which was prone to flooding. There are some taller chimneys in the town - illustrating the fact that the town used to put its fumes higher up to help escape the town's bowl.</p>

<h3>St Milburgas Well (Stoke St Milborough)</h3>
<img class="imgc" src="assets/images/folklore/2020-07-17_14_39_44_DSC_7444.jpg">
<p>A plaque at the site reads:</p>
<p>Saint Milburga was born in 664 AD, a daughter of the royal house of Mercia.  She became Abbess of Much Wenlock Priory.  Whilst visiting her estates here at Godstoc she fell from her horse and was rescued by two local farmers.  In gratitude she declared that water should always flow at this place and it became known as Saint Milburga's Well.  There were many pilgrimages here and the water was thought to heal sore eyes.  She is credited with other miracles and is often depicted with a goose as she banished a flock of them from ravishing her lands.  She is thought to have died around the year 727 and left a testament. which listed her estate including the one at Stoke St Milborough.</p>

<h3>St Oswalds Well, Oswestry</h3>
<img class="imgc" src="assets/images/folklore/2019-06-01_13_37_32_DSC_4458.jpg">
<p>An eagle (or raven) is said to have picked up Oswald's right arm and taken it to an ash tree, which gave the tree ageless vigor; when the bird dropped the arm onto the ground, a spring emerged from the ground. Both the tree and the spring were subsequently associated with healing miracles.</p>
<p>The name Oswestry literally means 'Oswald's tree'. Oswald was canonised, his feast day is 5th August.</p>

<h3>The Stiperstones - The Devils Chair</h3>
<img class="imgc" src="assets/images/folklore/2010-05-09_13-30-46_00009810.jpg">
<p>It is said that when the mist descends on the rock formation Satan and a coven of witches are meeting to plan ill deeds.</p>
<p>There are many legends of how the Devil's Chair came to be.  One suggests that the devil was carrying rocks to fill a nearby valley called Hell's Gutter.  He sat the rocks down to rest but when he got up, the apron he was carrying the rocks in broke and so the devil left the rocks where they had fallen, cursing them.</p>
<p>Another tells of a giantess who came collecting rocks and placing them in her apron.  The devil popped up and cut the apron strings causing the rocks to fall to the ground and the giantess ran away.  Since that day the devil returns to sit there and survey the world.</p>

<h3>The Wrekin - Needles Eye</h3>

<p>Another legend about the Wrekin suggests that you cannot be a true Salopian unless you have passed through the Needle's Eye, which is a split between two large rocks close to the summit.</p>

<h3>The Wrekin</h3>
<img class="imgc" src="assets/images/folklore/2020-03-01_14_22_57_DSC_6648.jpg">
<p>Thought to have been formed when a giant called Gwendol Wrekin ap Shenkin ap Mynyddmawr dumped a spadeful of earth - the giant had a grudge against the town of Shrewsbury and was intending to flood the town by depositing the earth there, but was dissuaded by a passing cobbler he met near Wellington who convinced him that Shrewsbury was very far away and so the giant decided to abandon the idea and dropped the earth.  The Ercall Hill is also said to have been formed when the giant scraped the mud off his boots.</p>
