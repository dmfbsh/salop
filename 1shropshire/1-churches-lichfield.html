<p>The oldest existing part of the present church is the north transept, which was built in 1635-36 as a burial chapel for the Needham family, the Viscounts Kilmorey of Shavington.  Sir Robert Needham was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Shropshire by 1596, a deputy lieutenant of the county in 1600 and High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1606-07.  He was a member of the Council in the Marches of Wales in 1609 and vice-president of the council in 1614.  He was a Member of the Parliament of England for Shropshire in 1593 and 1604 and was created Viscount Kilmorey in 1625.</p>
<p>The other remaining part of the older church is the tower, built in 1712.  The rest of the church was built in 1801 by Richard Baker; it is the only known work by this architect.  The chancel was restored in 1822.  The interior of the church was separated into two parts in circa 1970 (although the church records show this as having taken place in 1956) so that the nave could continue as the parish church and rest preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust.</p>
<p>The church is constructed in yellow-grey sandstone, with some red sandstone in the tower.</p>
<p>The cast iron window frames were made locally at Coalbrookdale, and for this reason the church is Grade I listed.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the north transept the carved wooden screen dates from circa 1637.  The font is Norman and is thought it may be a piece of stone taken from Wroxeter (upside column?).  The hexagonal pulpit dates from 1801.  The stained glass consists of 12 heraldic panels containing the Needham family arms.  The brass in the floor dates from circa 1390, it is thought that the head was removed in the Civil War.  The other brass commemorates Sir Robert Needham who died in 1556 and his wife who died in 1560.  This brass was lifted in circa 1970 and was found to be a 'palimpsest', i.e. an earlier brass (probably 14th Century and Flemish in origin), which had been cut up and reused.</p>
<p>The mounting block of four sandstone steps dates from 1774.</p>
<p>The name of the village derives from the Old English meaning 'Ealdthryth's wood/clearing', a leah (Old English) is a forest, wood, glade or clearing; (later) a pasture or a meadow.</p>

<p>From the time of the Anglo-Saxons until 1860 the Church was a chapel to the Collegiate Church of St Mary in Shrewsbury.  At the time of the Domesday survey a priest is mentioned, indicating the existence of a church building.  The earliest part of the present building dates from about 100 years after the Domesday survey.</p>
<p>The tower was built in 1837.</p>
<p>The church was restored in 1883.</p>
<p>The rood screen, altar and reredos date from the 1930s when the chancel was re-organised.</p>
<p>The church is notable as it has a bell dating from 1270, which is thought to have been cast in the churchyard by a travelling founder.  The bell was rehung in 2012 after being restored.  It is thought to be one of, if not the, oldest bells in the county and the diocese.</p>
<p>The name of the village in old English means 'east wood or clearing' (east and leah) and this is in relation to Albrighton.</p>

<p>This is the only church in England dedicated to St Eata of Hexham.</p>
<p>The first church to St Eata is said to have been built in the 8th Century but there is no longer any trace of this.  The present church has been on this site since at least 1075, this is known because the chronicler Orderic Vitalis (a Benedictine monk who wrote one of the great chronicles of 11th and 12th Century England) was baptised at the church on Easter Day in 1075.</p>
<p>The oldest part of the present church is the nave which dates from the late Saxon or early Norman period.  The tower is probably late 12th Century, the chancel late 13th Century and the south porch is dated 1665.  The church was restored in the late 19th Century.</p>
<p>The church is constructed from red and grey sandstone and incorporates some large blocks from the Roman city of Wroxeter.</p>
<p>The name Atcham is a contraction of Attingham, meaning 'the home of Eata's people'.</p>

<p>Some parts of the church are Norman (and date from the 12th Century).  The bottom four stages of the tower were constructed in the early 13th Century.  The top stage was added in circa 1400.</p>
<p>The church was restored in 1790 by Thomas Telford.  Further restorations were carried out in the late 19th Century.</p>
<p>The font dates from 1681, and there are monuments to Thomas Corbet, dated 1615, and Thomas Slaney M.P. for Shrewsbury, who served in eight parliaments.  There is also is an old chained Bible, given in 1770 by the Rev. Robert Jeffreys, vicar here for 58 years, who died in 1800.</p>
<p>The stained glass in the east window is by Kempe (1886).</p>
<p>The English name Baschurch first appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Bascherche, but the earliest references to Baschurch are under its Welsh name Eglwyssau Bassa (Churches of Bassa), in a seven-stanza englyn-poem of the same name found in the Welsh cycle of poems called Canu Heledd, generally thought to date to the ninth century.</p>

<p>The church was built just after the Battle of Shrewsbury as a chantry - a place of intercession and commemoration for those killed in the fighting.  The building is probably constructed over a mass burial pit as it is thought that some of the battle was fought at the place now known as Battlefield.</p>
<p>The church was originally a collegiate church, the main duty of the community was to perform a daily liturgy for the dead.  The college and chantry were dissolved in 1548 and the building was used as a parish church.  The building, however, deteriorated and became unused, it has been subject to various restorations.</p>

<p>Beckbury was included in the Domesday Book and the name means Beocca's Fort or defended place (Beocca being a personal name).</p>
<p>The parish was originally part of the estates of Wenlock Priory from at least 1120 AD and the connection is reflected in the dedication to St Milburga.  In the Middle Ages, Beckbury was a dependent chapelry of the parish of Holy Trinity, Much Wenlock.</p>
<p>The chancel is possibly 14th Century, the nave and the tower were added in 1731.</p>

<p>The name Buildwas may derive its name from the Saxon words 'beild' or 'belde' (a shelter). and 'was' (water), surrounded as it is on three sides by hills and on the fourth by the river Severn.  Another view is that the name is from the Old English 'waesse' which means 'swamp' or 'marsh' and is usually translated as 'land by a meanering river which floods and drains quickly'.</p>
<p>The village of Buildwas has been recognised since 1086 as the first reference to it was made in the Domesday Book.</p>
<p>There has been a church on the present site since medieval times, the present church dates from 1720.  The chancel was rebuilt in 1864, a painting from 1790 shows a shorter western turret with a flatter pyramid top - the present timber-framed belfry probably also dates from 1864.</p>
<p>Within the church are memorial tablets to members of two local families who were closely linked to the Industrial Revolution, including the Smithemans, who owned the site of Abraham Darby's first furnace in Coalbrookdale.  The pulpit is a fine Jacobean example.  The east window dates from 1864 and depicts scenes from the life of Christ.</p>
<p>In the churchyard, there are some unusual cast iron headstones and tombstones, which were cast locally.</p>

<p>The oldest part of the church is the chancel which is Early English (1180 to 1275).  As part of the rebuild of the church in 1886, it was moved stone by stone 13 feet further east.</p>
<p>The tower was added in the late 15th Century.</p>
<p>The medieval church was falling into disrepair by the 18th Century and was replaced in 1808.  This building was in turn replaced in 1887 by the present church.</p>
<p>The church is noted for the roof in the chancel chapel.  Some of the stained glass is by Kempe.  There are also some Minton tiles in the chancel.</p>
<p>The church contains a facsimilie reproduction of four pages (out of twelve) inscribed on velum of a 12th Century Breviary which is in the possession of the church (as the church was served by Haughmond Abbey, it is not improbable that the original was written there).</p>
<p>The church also has a Sanctus Bell which was probably used in the church prior to the reformation.</p>
<p>The name Cheswardine, recorded in 1086 as Ciseworde, in 1189 as Chesewordin and about 1650 as Cheswardyne, is probably derived from the Old English for 'cheese-producing settlement' or 'cheese farm'.</p>

<p>The nave is the oldest part of the church, but its date is unknown, thought to be 13th Century.  The arcades were added in the 13th Century (the south is circa 1200 and the north circa 1250).  The south aisle was rebuilt in the 14th Century.  The tower dates from circa 1500.</p>
<p>The north aisle and chancel were rebuilt in 1879.  The porch was also added in 1879.</p>
<p>The font is medieval.  The organ is considered to be a fine example of one by Nicolson and Lord (circa. 1880).  The Treble Bell dates from c. 1700, the second bell is by William Blews (Birmingham) from c. 1868, and the Tenor Bell is by John Clibury (Wellington) from 1590 (it is known as an 'Alphabet' bell).</p>
<p>The name of the settlement is possibly an old district name, from 'gravel' and 'bare', either originally applied to the site of High Ercall or to the hill known as The Ercall ('Ear' (Old English) Gravel, mud, earth and calu (Old English) bald, bare, lacking vegetation).  The affix 'child' may refer to a younger member of the Strange family who once held the manor.</p>

<p>Evidence suggests there was a little wooden church at the site in 599 AD (and noted in St Augustine's record of early Christian sites).  By Anglo-Saxon times the chapelry was held by the collegiate Church of St Mary, Shrewsbury.  Strong links were also established Haughmond Abbey as Clive was a profitable parish (although small).  By 1578 the parishioners had taken matters into their hands and raised sufficient funds to repair the chapel and appoint their own Minister.</p>
<p>The first major restoration occured from 1628-54.  A second rebuilding programme took place in 1849.  Finally, the church was fully restored in 1885-87 (made possible by the patronage of J J Bibby owner of the Liverpool shipping line and Hardwicke Grange and Thomas Meares, a tea plantation owner living at Clive Hall).  The spire was added in 1894 at the expense of J J Bibby in memory of his wife.  There is some medieval masonry remaining in the north wall and the north doorway (late Norman) was preserved from the original church.</p>
<p>The peal of six bells is the heaviest in the county, they were installed on 22nd September 1894 having been ordered in November 1892 from the John Taylor Bell Factory of Loughborough (at a total cost of 1,432 pounds 18 shillings 7 pence).  The collective weight requiring support has been calculated as in excess of 81 hundredweight or over 4 tons, and this set is currently ranked as the eleventh heaviest peal of six in the world, this standing calculated according to the weight of the large Tenor bell which alone weighs over 25 hundredweight.</p>
<p>The organ is an original by Henry Wills (Wills is regarded as the foremost organ builder of the Victorian era).</p>
<p>The name of settlement simply derives from the Old English 'clif' meaning an escarpment or hill slope.</p>

<p>It was  with the intention that St Leonard's at Malinslee would take over the role of parish church from  Holy Trinity church, especially as the majority of parishioners were living in the north of the parish around the Dawley Green, Malins Lee and Old Park areas.  The five bells, communion plate and chalice were moved to the new church at Malins Lee.  Legend has it that these were taken by Dawley parishioners one night and returned to Holy Trinity church when it was rebuilt in 1845.</p>
<p>The architect was Harvey Eginton who also built Broseley.</p>
<p>The font is late Norman and is a survivor from the old church (and is considered an excellent example).  It has a tree of life on one side.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means 'wood/clearing connected with Dealla' alternating with 'Dealla'a wood/clearing'.  Derived from a personal name and the Old English 'leah' meaning a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.</p>

<p>Eaton Constantine was originally a dependent chapelry of Leighton but became a separate parish in the later Middle Ages.  The original church was replaced in 1841 by the present building.</p>
<p>The only item remaining from the old church is the Norman font.</p>
<p>The name Eaton Constantine is derived from the old English words for river and farm/settlement (ea and tun respectively).  The settlement was held by Thomas de Constentin family in 1242.</p>

<p>The original Norman church was enlarged in the 13th Century, when the tower, porch and aisle were added.  It was then and almost completely rebuilt during the following two centuries, re-using some of the 13th Century material.  The church was further restored in 1877-78 by G E Street (best known as the designer of the Royal Courts of Justice).</p>
<p>Inside, the stone reredos dates from 1899 and was designed by Bodley and Garner, it depicts the Crucifixion and saints.  The window in the south wall of the chancel is by William Morris (1876), it depicts the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene.  The west window beyond the bell ringing chamber was created by Hardman in the nineteenth century, it shows St. Francis at the centre and the wonders of creation. The font is early Norman.</p>
<p>The painted sundial on the exterior is 18th Century.</p>
<p>The name Edgmond means 'Ecgmund's hill' - the settlement is situated at the summit of a hill 200-250 ft above sea level.</p>

<p>The name Bolas indicates a site on a flood plain (the site is on the confluence of the rivers Meese and Tern).</p>
<p>There was a medieval church at the site, but no trace of it remains.  It is known that there was a church in Great Bolas as early as the 13th century when, form the early registry transcribed by Rev W.G. D. Fletcher, the incumbent was 1306, Nov 10th, Alan de Newton, custodian.  Today, no part of the mediaeval building remains, except possibly two stones in the arch of the east window, behind the altar.</p>
<p>The present building consists of a Georgian nave and tower dated 1726 and an earlier chancel (which looks medieval, but is in fact 17th Century -  It was built in 1690 by Mr John Tourneor, who was rector of Bolas for 32 years, and who died on 18th January 1693).  This is recorded in the Register, which states that he was buried under the Communion Table in ‘This Chancell which hee unconstrainedly and generously erected on his sole charges about three years before his death.’</p>
<p>The then nave was taken down in 1726/27.  The register states ‘The Old church demolished on ye 10th April 1727.  The new nave and tower are built of brick, with stone quoins and dressings. The cost was £331, which was raised mostly by briefs’  (subscriptions and donations).</p>
<p>The builder (and presumably designer) of the nave and tower was John Willdigg.</p>
<p>The Royal Arms placed over the chancel arch are of the usual early Georgian type i.e. in the first quarter England and Scotland impaled; in the second quarter France modern, in the third quarter, Ireland; in the fourth quarter the King’s German domains.</p>
<p>The Great Bolas parish register dates from 1590. It contains the record of the marriage service of John Jones and Sarah Hoggins on 13th April 1790. This seems commonplace enough, but the John Jones who espoused the village peasant bride was really Henry Cecil and still married, shortly to become the tenth Earl and the first Marquis of Exeter.</p>
<p>The interior is authentic Georgian, with a full set of 18th Century box pews, pulpit with sounding board and communion rails.</p>
<p>During excavations for the new facilities (kitchen), skeltons were found and building works had to stopped due to the presence of anthrax.</p>

<p>The church originated as a collegiate church in the Saxon era, and is recorded in the Domesday Book.  The nave and the tower of the present church date from the 13th Century, and the chancel from the early part of the following century.  The upper part of the tower was either added or rebuilt during the 17th Century.  The south porch was described as being 'nearly new' in 1824.  In 1852 the chancel was re-roofed, and the church was partly restored in 1880.  The vestry was added in the late 19th Century.</p>
<p>The nave and tower are constructed in red sandstone.  The nave is in Early English style,  its windows being paired lancets.  The chancel is in Decorated style.</p>
<p>The chancel roof dates from 1852 and the nave roof is medieval.</p>
<p>The altar rail dates from the 17th Century, and incorporates turned balusters.  The chancel is floored with encaustic tiles, and in the west end of the nave are re-set medieval tiles.  The font is dated 1850 and the pulpit 1885; both are polygonal and in stone.  At the west end of the church is a gallery of 1765, carried on two square posts, and containing the organ.</p>
<p>Some of the windows contain 19th Century stained glass.  There is a ring of six bells, the oldest, cast by Thomas Clibury, is dated 1634.</p>
<p>In the churchyard is a sandstone churchyard cross dating from the 14th or 15th Century.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement is derived from the Anglian word naess - a ness, a promontory, a headland; a projecting piece of high land; a piece of land round which a river flows, to form a headland.</p>

<p>The church is a rare example of a new-Norman church and is built of red Grinshill sandstone.</p>
<p>The chancel screen was carved by six parishioners and presented in 1898 in commemoration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.  The pulpit was given in 1900 and the font in 1889.</p>
<p>Grinshill was originally a chapelry of Shawbury (known to be so as early as 1130 AD) and was an independent church by the 17th Century.  It has been suggested that some remains of prior buildings do exist at the base of the tower.</p>
<p>The origin of the name of settlement is uncertain, it may mean 'trap hill' (perhaps where animals were snared or it maybe describes the shape of the hill).  Grynel is an unknown Old English word, but maybe related to the word 'grin' for a noose or snare.  Hyll is the Anglian for a hill or elevated ground.</p>

<p>The church was designed by T. E. Owen in the Gothic style.  It is of red and yellow brick with Grinshill stone dressings.</p>
<p>In 1856 a chapel of ease was completed and consecrated on a site at Hadley.  The patronage was vested in the bishop, the archdeacon, the vicars of Wellington and Wrockwardine, and the rector of Kynnersley, and remained with them in 1981.</p>
<p>In 1858 a district chapelry was assigned comprising Horton township, most of Hadley township, and a small part of Arleston township. The curate became a titular vicar in 1868.  The cure was served by a priest-in-charge 1975-80 and was thereafter a vicarage.</p>

<p>The church was originally a chapel of ease (a church built within the bounds of a parish for those who could not easily attend the parish church), the Norman nave is thought to date from 1140 to 1150.  It is thought that the nave may have been rebuilt in the 14th Century.  The tower was added in the 1830s and the chancel was built in 1874.</p>
<p>General Sir Rowland Hill (died in 1842), who was Wellington's second in command at the Battle of Waterloo is buried in a sealed crypt beneath the tower and there is a monument to him in the church.</p>
<p>The name of the village is derived from the Old English meaning 'Headda's nook of land' ('halh' is a nook of land or a piece of land detached from the main area of its administrative unit).</p>

<p>Haughmond was an Augustinian monastery and was closely associated with the FitzAlan family (who became Earls of Arundel).</p>
<p>It was a successful and wealthy abbey.</p>
<p>The commission to dissolve the abbey was issued from Woodstock Palace on 23 August 1539 and signed by Thomas Cromwell. A deed of surrender was drawn up on 19 September. By 16 October, the abbot, the prior and 9 canons had signed to acknowledge Henry VIII as supreme over the Church of England.</p>
<p>The site was sold, some buildings were used as a private residence, others were plundered for building stone. During the Civil War, fire further destroyed the site and it was turned over for use as a farm.</p>

<p>At the time of the Domesday book, High Ercall was one of the most prosperous manors in the county.</p>
<p>The present church replaced an earlier church built at the end of the 11th Century and probably dedicated to Edward the Confessor.</p>
<p>The church was damaged in the Civil War; the extent of the damage is unclear as some accounts describe an almost total rebuild of the church between 1657 and 1662 whereas others suggest that the medieval church largely survived.</p>
<p>The church was also restored in 1864 to 1865.</p>
<p>The oldest part of the church is the Norman tympanum which has been dated to 1110-25 (and is now built into the north wall).  Also in the church is an effigy of a cross legged knight which is dated circa 1320.  On the external north wall of the tower is the fragment of an early carving depicting a crowned figure on horseback and inscribed St Edwardus.</p>
<p>The name of the village derives from the Old English meaning a high place (heah) of gravel, mud or earth (ear) which is bare or lacking in vegetation (calu).</p>

<h3>Hodnet - St Luke</h3>
<p><b>Grade: I</b></p>
<table><tr><td>
<img class="imgr" src="assets/images/churches/2019-03-02_15_39_58_DSC_3481.jpg" alt="" align="left">
<p>Hodnet has been an important village since Anglo-Saxon times (it is believed that there was a church on the site in Anglo-Saxon times, but no remnants exist).  The church is mentioned in the Domesday Book, however.  Following the Norman conquest, the church was founded and given to Shrewsbury Abbey, the Abbey held the church until it was disolved in 1540.  Prior to 1420, the church was dedicated to St Peter and St Paul and from 1420 St Luke.</p>
<p>The church is constructed of sandstone and is somewhat unusual in that it has twin 'naves' (the original nave is what is now the south asile), a long seven bay arcade and three gables at the east end.</p>
<p>In particular, it is noted for its tower which is entirely octagonal from top to bottom and the only tower of this type in Shropshire (it is thought that it was constructed by the same stonemasons who built Caernarvon Castle in Wales).  The belfry originally housed six bells, they were cast by Thomas Rudhall of Gloucester and installed in the tower in 1769.  Two further bells, by Taylors of Loughborough, were added in 1947 in memory of the fallen of the 1939-45 war.  The clock is dated 1848 and was made by Joyce of Whitchurch.</p>
<p>Much of the nave of the Norman church survives.  In the 14th Century, the Norman church was lengthened to provide a new and larger chancel.  The north aisle was also built in the 14th Century, alongside the old Norman church as was the tower.</p>
<p>The church was extensively restored in 1846.</p>
<p>In 1870, the mortuary chapel (the Heber chapel) was added, providing the third gable at the east end.  Bishop Heber is the most famous rector of Hodnet, he came to Hodnet in 1807 and remained for 15 years.  During that time he wrote many famous hymns.  In 1823, he became Bishop of Calcutta and so spent the rest of his in India.</p>
<p>The pulpit dates from 18th Century, and the font is most likely 17th Century (although it has Norman characteristics).</p>
<p>The window behind the organ was constructed to depict the evangelists and is the work of Shropshire artist David Evans.  This window has become famous because of the story of the Holy Grail of King Arthur and was brought to the public interest through the book the 'Da Vinci Code'.</p>
<p>The church has many impressive monuments, mostly dedicated to the Hill family of Hawkstone Hall.</p>
<p>Hodnet's name has Celtic origins derived from the Welsh hawdd meaning pleasant or peaceful and nant, a glen or valley.</p>

<p>Mentioned in the Doomsday book as Istefelt, the name Ightfield may derive from the Old English 'Ihtfeld' (Iht means creature and Feld means field), referring to the fact that the area was rural and farming was prevalent.

<p>The church has 15th Century origins and was partly rebuilt in the 19th Century (although records show a church here dedicated to St John the Baptist in 1072 AD).</p>

<p>Chenbritone’s (Kemberton’s) entry in the Domesday Book 1085-86 does not mention a church, but there is evidence of a Chaplain called Gilbert being here in 1230.</p>
<p>The dual dedication is unusual: the chancel to St. John the Baptist, and the nave to St. Andrew.</p>
<p>The present building is the sixth or seventh church here.  When a previous one was demolished in 1780, fragments of a 13th century style church were discovered.</p>
<p>In 1880, with an unsafe gallery and many previous repairs proving to be unsightly, it was decided to rebuild the church. Mr. Joseph Farmer was the architect, and Mr. Whittingham of Newport the builder.  Local sandstone was found to be unsuitable, so stone was purchased from Cosford.</p>
<p>The main part of the building was completed in 1882 and the porch was added in 1889.  At this stage the old red brick tower was left in situ, but in 1908 it was announced at a service that the villagers had at last raised enough money to add a new tower.</p>
<p>During the last rebuilding, medieval tiles were unearthed. These tiles, made originally in Wales, were a series of three hunting scenes: three hounds in chase; a man blowing a horn; and a stag and dogs. Craven Dunhill of Jackfield reproduced them for the floor of the new church, but for reasons unknown, only the last two scenes were used.</p>
<p>The altar table is a fine example of local craftsmanship.  It is the work of Mr. W. Pointon of Shifnal, and is dated 1840.  The reredos is a 14th Century design in modern stone.  The canopies house sculptures of the Ascension and four Old Testament saints.</p>
<p>The pulpit is of pink and white marble, a figure of John the Baptist stands in the front.</p>
<p>There is a peal of four bells on a wooden frame. The bells are dated: 1596, 1621, 1671 and 1753.</p>
<p>The royal coat of arms on the South wall is an unsigned, undated, painting. The arms themselves are of George I (1714-1724), but above it is written G III R (1760-1820).</p>
<p>Kemberton means 'Cenbeorht's farm/settlement', an Old English personal name.</p>

<p>Lawley was originally a small hamlet, however, the population increased with the discovery of clay and coal just beneath the surface in the 19th Century.  Although within 10 years of the church being built, the coal had been worked out and there was a mass migration away from the area.</p>
<p>Local farmer Bartholomew Yates engaged with the bishop to requst a church be built, one agrument was that when there was funeral the people had to walk with the coffin to Wellington or Malinslee (four or five miles).</p>
<p>The church was originally a chapel of ease, built on land donated by the Coalbrookdake Company (the main employer of Lawley's residents) and Lord Forrester.  Much of the building cost was borne by partners of the Coalbrookdale Company.</p>
<p>The first minister, Thomas Ragg, served from 1865 to 1881.  He was self-educated and was ordained in 1858.</p>
<p>The church was designed by John Ladds in the Gothic style.  It is of red and yellow brick with stone dressings.  The single bell, made in 1865, was added in 1915.</p>
<p>Lawley is recorded in the Domesday book, but it was of little value.  The name of the setllement derives from the Old English Lafa's Wood (Lafa is a personal name) and 'leah' is wood or glade.</p>

<p>The architect was Samuel Poultney Smith and the builder was Mr Cartwright of Ellesmere.</p>

<p>The Abbey was founded around 1148 AD for a community of what is thought to be about 13 Augustinian canons from Dorchester Abbey in Oxfordshire.</p>
<p>During the 13th Century, the Abbey enjoyed great wealth and prestige - a respectable income was derived from a variety of sources, including even the tolls for the use of the Atcham Bridge. The then king (Henry III) was entertained at the Abbey twice in about 1240 AD.</p>
<p>The Abbey suffered financial problems in the 14th Century (the abbott was accused of mismanagement).</p>
<p>The Abbey was closed in 1538, as part of the Suppression of the Monasteries. The site then became a private dwelling until the mid-17th Century.</p>
<p>During the Civil War, the former Abbey buildings were severely damaged by Parliamentarian troops, at which point the site was abandoned and left to decay.</p>

<p>The earliest part of the present building is the south doorway which is late-Norman.  However, it is thought that there has been a church on the site since the 7th century.  St Chad is said to have visited Lilla's Hill to spread the Gospel in 670AD, and a small Saxon church was built.</p>
<p>In the Domesday book this was one of manors held on behalf of St Alkmund's, Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The present building was built in stages over 400 years.  Parts of the nave also date back to Norman times, while the chancel is Early English and the north aisle was added in about 1300.</p>
<p>At the west end of the nave is a Royal Coat of Arms with the initials CR, it is unknown if this is for Charles I or II.</p>
<p>The roofs are thought to be late medieval.</p>
<p>The reredos were presented to the church by the Duchess of Sutherland during the 1856 restoration.  It is a sculpture in a single piece of stone depicting the Biblical seen of Jesus at table in the village of Emmaus, near Jerusalem, following the Resurrection. In the carving, sculptor John Farmer of London captures the moment when the two disciples recognised Jesus, as recorded in Luke's Gospel.</p>
<p>The church has a fine two-manual organ which was installed in 1891.</p>
<p>In the north wall of the chancel is one of the finest monuments in Shropshire, dedicated to Sir Richard Leveson (d. 1661) and and his wife (d. 1664). It features two reclining figures, with an architectural surround, columns on each side and a pediment above.  Sir Richard Leveson was a politician who supported the Royalists during the Civil War.</p>
<p>The font, with its intricate carvings, is thought to predate the church, possibly dating back to circa 900AD.   There is a story that it originally came from Lilleshall Abbey, but it has also been suggested that it might have been in the original Saxon church.</p>
<p>On the outside of the church is a sundial (in situ by 1787) and a bronze wall tablet.  The tablet was put up in 1896 and indicates how to obtain the time by adding and subtracting various numbers on certain days of the year. Prior to 'Railway Time' each town had its own time based on noon and measured by local sundials.</p>
<p>The name of settlement means Lill's (personal name) Hill.</p>

<p>Malinslee had a 12th Century chapel, which was likely in the parish of Shifnal.  The chapel fell into disrepair in the 19th Century and was demolished in 1971.</p>
<p>A new church was required in the area to accommodate the increasing population during the early Industrial Revolution.  The church is the third and last of Thomas Telford's three Shropshire churches.  It is similar to Madeley in that it is externally octagonal and built of ashlar.</p>
<p>It was originally built to seat 800 people, but the galleries were extended in the 1830’s to allow for a further 200 seats The bells, a medieval silver paten and a chalice were taken from the Holy Trinity Church in Dawley to St Leonard’s as it was to be the parish church.</p>
<p>After pressure from some parishioners for the reopening of Holy Trinity at Dawley, services were resumed there in 1818.  In addition, the plan for St Leonard’s to be the parish church for Dawley was halted in 1821 when it was discovered that an Act of Parliament would be needed to recognise its status.  To promote an Act of Parliament would have been be too costly so the plan was abandoned and St Leonard’s then operated under Dawley Church as a chapel of ease until it was assigned a chapel district in 1843 in recognition of the growing population of the area.</p>
<p>Legend has it that some male parishioners from Holy Trinity came one night and took back the bells, 16th. Century silver plate and the chalice dating from 1746 that had been given to St Leonard’s and in 1845 they were returned to Holy Trinity.  A new set of plate was donated in 1833 and 5 bells in 1839 to replace the stolen items.</p>
<p>There is some notable stained glass in the church in the style of Morris and Co.</p>

<p>There is a local tradition that Robert Clive (1725-74), later to become Lord Clive of India, climbed the church tower and sat astride a gargoyle when he was attending the grammar school (q.v.) nearby.</p>
<p>Market Drayton is on the River Tern, and was formerly known as 'Drayton in Hales' (c. 1868) and earlier simply as 'Drayton' (c. 1695).  The town is of Saxon origin and was referred to as Draituane in the Doomsday Book.  A Drayton (OE  draegtun) is a settlement where dragging takes place.  The name is considered to refer to a portage on a river in some instances, and to a steep slope in others.  In this instance the likeliest reference seems to be to the use of sledges, rather than wheeled vehicles, on marshy ground.</p>

<p>Melverley means 'meadow by the mill-ford'.</p>
<p>The church stands very close to the river Vyrnwy.</p>
<p>The medieval church was burnt by Owain Glyndwr in 1401.  The present church was built soon after.</p>
<p>It is noted for being one of just a small number of half timbered churches in the country.  The entire structure is held together with just pegs.  The fact that the wattle and daub is narrower than the timbers shows the early construction of this church using this technique.</p>

<p>The present building is Victorian, it replaces an 18th Century brick church which itself replaced a medieval church.</p>
<p>The church is considered to be the best Edward Haycock junior designed church in Shropshire (he is responsible for six other churches in the county).</p>
<p>The church is noted as it houses one of the best sets of stained glass by Morris and Co in the country.  There are windows by Burne-Jones, Maddox Brown and Morris.  There are also two windows in a different style by Kempe.</p>
<p>Meole Brace was originally a separate village, the manor of Meole is recorded in the Domesday book.  Meole is the name of the river and Brace is derived from Aldolf de Bracy who held the manor in 1206.</p>

<p>The church is situated on a knoll above the river Severn.  There was originally a medieval church on the site, but it was replaced in 1737 - 1738 by the present building.  The church was designed by William Cooper of Shrewsbury and is built of red sandstone.  The church was restored in 1884.  A few medieval tiles in the chancel are the only known relics of the old church.</p>
<p>The reredos (19th Century) is notable and there is some good stained glass by Burlison and Grylls.  The royal coat of arms is painted on canvas.  The new church originally had 3 bells from the previous church dated (1656, 1670 and 1717), but these were sold to help fund a new peel of 6 bells.</p>
<p>The father and sisters of Charles Darwin are buried in the churchyard, and his mother (the eldest child of Josiah Wedgwood) is buried in the chancel, though there is nothing to mark the position.  It is unknown exactly why the Darwin's are buried here - it is known they visited West Felton and Montford would have been a prominent landmark on the way, alternatively, they may have chosen Montford because of difficulties with burials for Unitarians at the Shrewsbury church.</p>
<p>The origin of the place name is uncertain, it may mean 'community ford' (mana is the Old English for a community), as it was a place for meetings between English and Welsh representatives during times of negotiation.  The spelling with the T came about because of the association with Simon de Montfort in the 13th century and became more or less official when the lord of the manor, Henry Bromley, was made Lord Montfort in 1741.  Clive of India bought the land in 1760.</p>

<p>The Norman church was founded in about 1140 AD as a chapel attached to Shawbury. Some parts of the Norman church remain, but the greater part of the church dates from the 14th Century.</p>
<p>The south aisle is effectively a memorial chapel to the Corbet family and was constructed in the mid-14th Century. The base of the tower was constructed in around 1539 and features the arms of the Prince of Wales (later Edward VI). It is unknown whether it was originally finished to its full height, as it is possible that the upper stages were damaged during military action in the Civil War. The present upper stages of the tower date from 1769.</p>
<p>The church has an unusual triangular window, similar to one in Alberbury, which was another of the Corbet family's holdings.</p>
<p>The interior contains numerous monuments to the Corbet family including two chest tombs dated 1513 and 1567, a baroque wall monument to Richard Corbet dated 1691 and a number of 18th Century monuments. It is known that Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, the architect of the Ironbridge, Coalbrookdale, carried out work here.</p>
<p>The church has a decorative scheme by Ninian Comper dating from 1904 in memory of Vincent Corbet who died at Eton at the age of thirteen. The scheme encompasses most of the chancel interior and includes a stained glass window, communion table, alabaster reredos and canopy, and high quality painted decorations to the walls and roof timbers.</p>

<p>Originally a Saxon foundation pre 1066 held by Siward the Saxon and later given to Shrewsbury Abbey by Warin the Bold.  Nothing is known of the early church.</p>
<p>The tower was rebuilt in 1634, it had deteriorated badly during the Rectorship of Ralph Kynaston - he had offered to rebuild the tower to his own height if the parishioners paid for the rest (Kynaston died in 1629).</p>
<p>The rest of the church was rebuilt in 1744.</p>
<p>Inside the church is a ducking stool from 1660-1685.</p>
<p>There are three bells. The tenor bell on which the clock strikes weighs 7cwt and was cast by Thomas Clibury of Wellington in 1668.  The second bell is undated is thought to be the work of Michael de Lichfield and cast in his Staffordshire foundry circa 1280.  The treble bell is was cast by Abraham Rudhall of Gloucester.</p>
<p>The organ is by William Hill, of which very few survive.  Unusually the stops are reversed in that those keys that are normally white are black and vice versa.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement is derived from the Old English mydel meaning 'small confluence', although this is not supported by any present day features of the landscape.  It is named in the Domesday Book as Mulleht.</p>

<p>After the civil war the villagers of Newtown and other nearby villages desired to have a chapel of ease as the parish church of Wem was too far away.  Initially a private house was used which was consecrated after the Restoration in 1665.  In 1836 this building was demolished and replaced with a brick church.  In 1861 the parish was formed and in 1869 the brick church was replaced with the present stone church.</p>
<p>The church has an unusual Carillon of 6 bells.</p>
<p>The pulpit is marble and dates from 1898.</p>
<p>The elegant wrought-iron screen dates from circa 1870.</p>
<p>The name of the village simply equates to the Old English new (niwe) and enclosure, farmstead or village (tun).</p>

<p>There was an earlier church on the site, but nothing of this building remains.  Of the present church, the chancel was built in the 13th Century and the tower in the 14th Century.  The church was restored in the 19th Century, re-opening in 1865.</p>
<p>Outside the church is the older font dating from the 12th or 13th Century.</p>
<p>The arch once connected the church to the rectory, the figure in the niche at the apex  is St Chad in his episcopal cope and mitre.</p>
<p>The church has an octagonal baptistery (a baptistery is commonly octagonal in plan, a visual metaphor for the number eight, which symbolised a new beginning in Christian numerology).</p>
<p>The church is notable as it has one of the earliest known commissions by Inigo Jones.  Dating from 1606 and made from Derbyshire alabaster, the commission is a monument to Frances Cotton who died in childbirth.  The monument was later amended to incorporate Sir Rowland Cotton himself who died in 1635. Cotton had various appointments in Shropshire including High Sheriff, member of the Council of the Marches and MP.</p>
<p>In 1553 the church had three great bells and one Sanctus bell.  Today the church has eight bells.</p>
<p>The nave is paved of white marble.  The chancel has some Jacobean (1567 to 1625) carving and panelling.  The pulpit is Caen stone and is supported by 16 marble pillars.</p>
<p>The name Norton in Old English is North farm/settlement.  Hales, in Old English halh meaning 'nooks of land', is an old district name which refers to land on both sides of the Shropshire-Staffordshire border.</p>

<p>The church was built because St Oswald’s could not accommodate the town’s growing population.  The architect was Thomas Penson (the younger) who also built Llanymynech and various churches in Wales.  The Lady chapel was added in 1894.  At the same time a north-west tower with a timber spire was added by Eustace Frere.  An unusual feature is the lancet window filled with stained glass in memory of Queen Victoria.  The font is a marble baluster.</p>

<p>In 642 AD Oswald, the King of Northumbria who had previously converted to Christianity was killed by the pagan King Penda of Mercia in the Battle of Oswestry, as a result he rose to martyrdom.  He is thought to have been killed on the site of the church.</p>
<p>The present church was built in the 13th Century.  Only the lower parts of the tower remain from the original building as the church was heavily damaged in the Civil War (having been used as a lookout tower).  The church was rebuilt in the 17th Century and further restored in the 19th Century.  Most of the windows are Victorian.</p>
<p>The church has a memorial to the Yale family - a descendant of the figures in the memorial made his fortune in India in the 18th Century and gave his money to a fledgling university in the USA - Yale.</p>

<p>This church is notable because it is the first Victorian church in Shropshire to break with the Gothic tradition.  It was designed by Richard Norman Shaw (considered to be among the greatest of British architects).</p>
<p>The Chapel of the Epiphany, Peplow was commissioned and paid for by the Stanier family from Peplow Hall.  The Chapel remained part of the Peplow Hall estate until the late 1940’s-early 1950’s, when it passed to the Lichfield Diocese.</p>
<p>The screen, pulpit and font are all by the architect.  The south window is by Heaton, Butler and Bayne.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means pebble tumulus or hill in Old English.  It is recorded in the Domesday Book as Papelaw, and despite its ancient origin there is no village here.</p>

<p>The church was originally built as a chapel of ease in the 12th Century, but later became a parish church. The date of the change to church is unknown, but is likely some time in the 14th or 15th Century.</p>
<p>In 1866 part of the medieval church was demolished, just the chancel was retained which became the south aisle of a new church.</p>
<p>The Victorian church was pulled down in 1973, leaving the medieval chancel as the church once again.  The 19th Century arcade was blocked, and now forms the north wall of the remaining building.  A bell from Preston Gubbals is now installed in St Alkmund's Church in Shrewsbury, the bell was cast 1720.</p>
<p>The sundial in the churchyard was originally a churchyard cross, dated 1638.</p>
<p>The name of the village in Old English means 'Priests' farm/settlement (tun)'.  It was held in 1086 by a priest name Godebold who was a tenant of St. Alkmund's church in Shrewsbury, the name was corrupted to Gubbals.</p>

<p>The name 'Priorslee' is partly Latin and is a combination of the word prios, which means monk or priest and lee which is the Anglo-Saxon name for a clearing in the wood.  The area of Priorslee was once owned by the Priors of Wombridge Priory.</p>
<p>A chapel was built at Priorslee in about 1150.  The font from this chapel now stands outside the front door of the present Priorslee Church.</p>
<p>A new church was built at Mumpton Hill, the old chapel was demolished in 1838. The parish did not become independent until 1863 when it separated from Shifnal.  The new church was dedicated to St Peter and completely restored in 1887.</p>
<p>Priorslee was an ancient chapelry of Shifnal, and there was a medieval church on the site which was replaced by the current building.</p>
<p>The enormous gilt reredos was imported from another church.</p>
<p>The Church of St Peter was designed by Francis Halley of Shifnal and built between 1825 - 1827.  The church is constructed in brindle brickwork with stone dressings and has slate-covered roofs.  Concealed ferrous metal cramps have disrupted the masonry to the tower bell lights which has resulted in sections of stone falling off.  The vestry has settled and rotated away from the chancel wall.</p>

<p>The domesday book mentions the presence of both a priest and a church at this place.  The medieval church is long gone however, a Georgian church built at this site in 1751 and this was in turn replaced with the present Victorian church.</p>
<p>In 1929, a section of wall of the medieval church was discovered.</p>
<p>The place name Rodington is derived from name of the river (Roden), the origin of which is unknown, and the Old English 'tun' meaning farm or settlement.</p>

<p>Originally a dependent chapelry of Baschurch and founded c.1140, Ruyton became a separate parish in 1230. The tithes were appropriated by Haughmond Abbey in 1331.</p>
<p>The church is built of red standstone.  The oldest part of church is the chancel where Norman windows remain.  The nave is also Norman.  The mid-14th Century north aisle was rebuilt in 1845.  The tower is early 15th Century.  The chancel was rstored in 1862 and the rest of the church in 1868.</p>
<p>In the south is a low down door that leads to a tiny chamber, which may have been an anchorite's cell.</p>
<p>On one pillar in the arcade is a horned head, possibly representing the devil.</p>
<p>The reredos is an example of late Victorian art, it was designed by Bodley and Garner in 1892 and depicts the baptism of Christ.</p>
<p>Mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Ruitone, the village acquired its unusual compound name in the twelfth century when a castle was built, and it became the major manor of eleven local townships. The Roman numeral for eleven, whose earliest occurrence is stated to be 1379, is included in its name. Some of the eleven ancient townships, mostly situated to the north and west of Ruyton (Old English - rye farm/settlement), still survive as hamlets today; although some, like Coton, are just a collection of farm buildings. The eleven were Ruyton, Coton, Shotatton, Shelvock, Eardiston and Wykey, which remain in the parish; and Felton, Haughton, Rednal, Sutton and Tedsmore, now in the parish of West Felton.</p>

<p>The church seems to have some medieval stonework but there are no records or evidence about the church until 1710 when a plaque in the tower wall commemorates the church wardens who were probably responsible for the building of the tower.  Originally there were three bells, two were added in 1887 to mark the queen' Victoria’s golden jubilee and a sixth was added in 1993.</p>
<p>The font is unusually recessed into the tower arch, the style of its decoration suggests 14th Century.</p>
<p>In 1720 there is a record of the building of the chancel.  The church was restored in 1874.  In1886 the north aisle was built.</p>
<p>There is one memorial entirely in Latin, which is unusual.  It is to the landscape gardener Romolo Piazzani, who in 1905 built Ryton Hall.</p>
<p>The settlement was referred to as Ruitone in the Domesday Book - Ryton is a common village name where there is light sandy soil and means rye farm.</p>

<p>The village is close to Offa's Dyke and the dyke bounds the parish on the west, the name derives from sulh and tun which means in Old English a plough(-land) farm/settlement, or perhaps, a gully farm/settlement and has also been modified by Welsh influence.</p>
<p>The churchyard has a number of very old yew trees, suggesting that the site has been a place of Christian worship for over 1000 years.  However, the church itself is first mentioned in the Papal Tax records in 1291.  The church is noted for its 13th Century font and the barrel roof over the chancel, which is thought to be from the 14th Century.  The north and south transepts were added in 1821-28.  The church was extensively rebuilt in 1891-92.</p>

<p>The church was altered and restored in 1603 and again in 1875.</p>
<p>The font is Norman, above it is a brass chandelier which is 18th Century.  The pulpit is Jacobean, dated 1612.  In one of south windows in the chancel are some fragments of 15th Century stained glass.  The carved reredos behind the altar dates from 1881.</p>

<p>Shifnal was an important ecclesiastical centre in Saxon times, and it was a minster of an extensive Saxon parish.  In the Domesday Book, the settlement was known as Iteshale and later became Idshall.  The name Shifnal came into use in the 14th Century and over time replaced the previous name.  In the 12th Century, the church was acquired by Shrewsbury Abbey.</p>
<p>The main part (nave, porch, aisles, transepts and tower) of the present building is Early English (13th Century), and there are some remains of the earlier Norman church.  The chancel and south chapel were built during the Decorated era.  The Norman chancel ended where the communion rails are now.</p>
<p>The south porch is a two-storey structure.</p>
<p>The chancel arch is Norman and round-headed, on of west side of the arch is some dogtooth decoration.  Above the dogtooth is an unusual Norman carving, which Cranage notes 'It appears to be a fruit-bearing twisted branch coming out of the mouth of a human head.  There is a large finial above.'.</p>
<p>The hammer-beam roofs are 16th Century, as the original roof was damaged in an extensive fire in Shifnal in 1591.</p>
<p>The font is Victorian as are the west window of the nave and the east window of the chancel.  The pulpit is Jacobean.  There are some notable memorials - Olive Briggs (d. 1596), an alabaster effigy on a tomb chest, Humphry Briggs (d. 1626) and his wife, again effigies on a tomb chest, Thomas Forster (priest, d. 1526) in a tomb recess and a bust of Magdalen  Briggs (d. 1598).</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means Scuffa's nook of land.  It was also known as Iddeshale, Idi's nook of land.  Halh is nook of land in Anglian.</p>

<p>The Abbey was founded in 1083 as a Benedictine monastery by the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, Roger de Montgomery (who received Shropshire from William the Conqueror in 1071). It grew to be one of the most important and influential abbeys in England, and an important centre of pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Also known as the abbey church of St Peter and St Paul.</p>
<p>The abbey was one of the last to surrender (being at the end of the commissioners circuit) and was dissolved on 24th January 1540.</p>

<p>Founded by the Rev. Thomas Mainwaring Bulkeley Bulkeley-Owen and built by Edward Haycock jun., the church was consecrated in 1879.  Historically it was built for the Oxford Movement (a movement largely associated with the University of Oxford, it argued for the reinstatement of some older Christian traditions of faith and their inclusion into Anglican liturgy and theology), and it has the architecture to support this.</p>
<p>The church has the most important surviving John Nicholson organ in the country, a very important instrument historically.  There are two stained glass windows by Kempe in the north aisle, the nave window is of Whitefriars glass, and one windows is the in arts and crafts style from the workshop of William Morris.</p>
<p>There is a Banner designed by The Revd Ernest Geldart, stitched by Mary and Harriet Cope and recently restored.  It has a huge rood cross dedicated to the unknown fallen of the First World War.</p>
<p>The church notably lacks a tower.</p>

<p>St Alkmund died circa 802 AD, he was the younger son of Alhred (king of Northumbria) at Lilleshall, his relics were removed to the collegiate church dedicated to him at Derby.  This church in Shrewsbury was also founded as a collegiate church in 912 AD by Aethelflaed, daughter of Alfred the Great, king of Mercia.  By the time of the Domesday survey, the church was substantially endowed.  However, when Lilleshall Abbey was established in 1148 AD, the church became a poor vicarage as property was transferred to Lilleshall. The original medieval church is thought to have been a very fine example.</p>
<p>The original Saxon church was rebuilt more than once. The first significant part of the building to remain to the present day is the tower and 184-foot spire, which were built around 1475 AD. Following the collapse of Old St Chad's in 1788, there was concern about the safety of the church.  An act of Parliament decreed the demolition and rebuilding of all but the tower; the rest of the churches dates from circa  1794-5.</p>
<p>There is Tudor glass in the West window, dating from mid 16th century.</p>
<p>The church stands at the highest point in the town.</p>

<p>St Chad was the first Bishop of Mercia, he was canonised in 779 AD.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the tower of the original St Chad's church, the new church was built to a design by George Steuart (who had previously designed Attingham Park).</p>
<p>This church is considered to be the finest 18th Century church in Shropshire.  The most striking feature being the circular nave.  The church is brick built and faced with Grinshill stone.</p>

<p>The church of St Giles was first recorded in 1136, was originally part of St. Giles Hospital for Lepers and the Infirm (probably situated west of the church) which was first recorded in 1155.  However, the present church is largely Victorian and the work of Samuel Pountney Smith, who extensively re-modelled the church but retained much of the fabric of the medieval chapel within the present building.  Vestries and an organ chamber were added in 1895.</p>
<p>The north arcade is 14th Century and the former chancel arch from the same period is now placed between the north aisle and chancel, immediately adjacent to a Victoran arch, giving a very odd effect,</p>
<p>From the mid 15th Century the church became a parish church with Holy Cross (Shrewsbury Abbey).  Prior to 1836, however, services were held only twice yearly.</p>
<p>In 1857 St Giles and Sutton became a parish in its own right and today works together with the parish of St Eata, Atcham.</p>
<p>The Norman font is very good (thought to originally have come from High Ercall).  There is stained glass by David Evans and Kempe.</p>

<p>The original church is either late 11th Century or early 12th Century, there is Norman herring-bone masonry in one wall.  The south aisle was added to in the late 13th Century or 14th Century.  The tower is 13th Century with a late 14th Century belfry.  The porch is dated 1593.  The east end of the chancel was rebuilt in 1740 and the church was restored in 1891 - 1892.</p>
<p>The church has very large stepped diagonal west buttresses, one has a datestone recording named churchwardens amongst other things.</p>
<p>The chancel arch is Victorian.  The pulpit is late 17th Century.  The panelling in the chancel is probably the old box pews.  The reredos dates from 1896.</p>
<p>The churchyard is circular and notably raised above the surrounding area.  This is thought to be an early Irish / Welsh tradition which influenced churches in later centuries, there are a few other examples of this in Shropshire.</p>
<p>The name Stanton means stone farm or settlement in Old English (stan is a stone or rock and tun is a farmstead or settlement).  The suffix means either servant's heath or monastic community's heath.</p>

<p>The church was first recorded in 1238 AD when it was given by Osbert, Lord of Stirchley, to Wenlock Priory.  But the church is older than this as the chancel is Norman.</p>
<p>The chancel arch is the main feature of the church, and is considered one of the two finest in the county (the other being at Upton Cressett).</p>
<p>The masonry of the nave and tower was encased in brick circa 1740, and the north aisle (brick) was added in 1838.</p>
<p>The box pews, reading desk and pulpit are from circa 1740.  The stained glass is Victorian.  The church became redundant in 1978.</p>
<p>There is a ring of three bells.  These were cast in 1410 by John de Colsale, in 1594 by Henry II Oldfield, and in 1664 by Thomas II Clibury.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement literally mans 'bullock/heifer wood/clearing' from the Old English 'stirc' (a stirk, a young bullock or heifer) and leah (a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow).</p>

<p>This church has 12th Century origins.  The lower part of the tower is Perpendicular (perhaps 14th Century) and the upper part dates from early 17th Century.  The church was heavily restored in 1858-8 at the expense of TC Whitmore of Apley Park, when th eold walls of the nave and chancel were refaced both on the inside and the outside.  Internally, the roofs are notable, there is a wagon-roof in the nave (which may include some Jacobean timbers) and a panelled oak ceiling in the chancel.</p>
<p>The place name probably derives from the old English for 'farm/settlement associated with an outlying farm/settlement', as 'stoc' is the old English for a place or secondary settlement and 'tun' is the old English for a farmstead or settlement.</p>

<p>At the time of the Domesday survey, the settlement was known as Sudtone (south town) as it was the southern part of the Saxon Parish of Iteshale (Shifnal).</p>
<p>The &quot;Maddock&quot; was added in the 13th century when Sutton was granted to Iorwerth Goch (son of the ruler of Powys) in recognition of his interpreter services between England and Wales during the reign of  Henry II.  Sutton was passed to Madoc who was Iorwerth's son, but it is thought that a later member of the family also named Madoc is the one who actually gave the family name to the settlement.</p>
<p>The original church may be as early as 11th Century (although it was probably a chapel annexed to Shifnal).</p>
<p>The original church was replaced in the 16th Century.  In 1887, the church was rebuilt again (at a cost of 2528 pounds), the only part of the 16th Century church that was retained was the tower.</p>
<p>The orgain was donated in 1889.  In 1963, the heating pipes spilt due to the heavy frost and so the coal-fired heating system was replaced by an electrical one.</p>
<p>The east window was given in 1908 by Mr Charles Bruff of the Coalport China factory in memory of his mother who lived to be 102.  In 1923, the wooden reredos was presented to the church, but it obscured part of the east window. Because of this, the Bruff familiy never came to the church again, even after the reredos was altered to make the whole window visible again.</p>
<p>There is a plaque in the tower to William Farmer and his wife Elizabeth, who helped Charles II during his stay at Boscobel.</p>
<p>The name of village means south farm / settlement (Sutton) in Old English and Madoc is a family name.</p>

<p>Sometimes referred to as the 'Westminster Abbey of the Midlands'; the church is noted for its architecture which includes a fan vaulted side chapel (which is rare in Shropshire) and its numerous tombs.</p>
<p>The church was founded by the widowed Isabel Lingen as a chantry and collegiate church.  The commission to dissolve the college was issued on 17th September 1546 and referred to the legislation that permitted the king's commissioners to seize property on his behalf.</p>
<p>The church is a cruciform building (rare for the Perpendicular era) and is built of red sandstone (which is abundant locally).  The church is noted for its bourdon bell which weighs over 2 tonnes and is called the Great Bell of Tong - claimed to be the loudest and biggest bell in Shropshire.  It had been feared that the tower would not support continued tolling, so it is rung only on certain days / occasions which gives the vicar of the church an equal status with the local noble families and the sitting monarch.</p>
<p>The name Tong is derived from the old English 'tweonga' meaning a pinched piece or a spit of land, in this case, it describes the situation of the village between the two headstreams of the River Worfe.</p>

<p>Magna is Latin, meaning 'great', so the translation of Upton Magna is 'Great Upton'.  Upton derives from the old English for a settlement on higher ground.</p>
<p>The nave and chancel are originally Norman, as is the south doorway of the Nave.  Some original masonry survives in the chancel but the church was substantially rebuilt and enriched by the architect G E Street (best known as the designer of the Royal Courts of Justice) in the 1850s and 1860s.  The tower is Perpendicular (the final phase of Gothic architecture, which spanned the late 14th Century to the early 16th Century).</p>
<p>Inside the church are several medieval wall paintings.</p>
<p>One of the bells in notable as it is quite rare, it is one of only 37 (approx.)cast at a foundry in Exeter in circa 1475 to 1499.</p>
<p>This church is the only one in Shropshire dedicated to St Lucy (a Christian martyr who died during the Diocletianic Persecution - the last and most severe persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire).</p>

<p>This is one of G E Street's smaller churches in Shropshire.  It is notable because of the quality of the window tracery.  Many of the windows have 19th Century and early 20th Centiury glass which is considered to be of above avergae quality.</p>
<p>Walter de Opton was the tenant in 1242, and upp is the Old English for 'up, higher up or upon' (and tun is the Old English for an enclosure or framstead).  So the name of the village derives from Walter de Opton's higher farm or settlement.</p>

<p>The present church was built to replace a medieval one which was damaged during the Civil War.  The church was designed by George Steuart who was also responsible for St Chad's in Shrewsbury - All Saints being built a little earlier and is less impressive than St Chad's.  No extensions have been added, but the interior has been modified on a number of occasions.</p>
<p>This was the first Shropshire church to introduce an entrance front in the form of a monumental classical temple portico.  The building is made of Grinshill stone with a slate roof.</p>
<p>There is mention of a priest at the site in the Domesday book.  The origin of the name of the town is uncertain, but is likely to mean farm or settlement of a Saxon settler - Weola.</p>

<p>The present church was preceeded by a Saxon or Norman church, a medieval building dating from 1391 and church built in 1788 which became inadequate for the needs of the parish and fell into disrepair.  In 1861 a new building was commissioned from the leading architect of the day Sir George Gilbert Scott.  The walls are of yellow sandstone ashlar; the church has a slate roof which has a lozenge pattern over the nave and a zig-zag pattern over the chancel.</p>
<p>Welshampton is recorded in the Domesday book as Hantone, meaning high farm or settlement.  The prefix 'Welsh' is a reflection of its proximity to Flintshire.</p>
<p>An African prince is buried in the churchyard - the then vicar was as offered a post in Lesotho, which he turned down but maintained contact with the country.  The prince came to England to train as a priest and visited Welshampton when the new church was consecrated in 1863, but during the visit he caught a fever and died and so was buried at the church.</p>

<p>Whitchurch is the oldest continually inhabited town in Shropshire.</p>
<p>Whitchurch acquired its present name after the construction of a Norman church in white Grinshill stone (replacing a wooden Saxon church), from the Middle English for 'White Church'.  Originally a Roman settlement it was half way between Wroxeter and Chester and so was known as Mediolanum (the place in the middle of the plain).  In the Doomsday book it was known as Westune (indicating its situation on the Western border of England).</p>
<p>The Norman church was extended in medieval times, but collaspsed on Sunday 31st July 1711.</p>
<p>The present church was built on the same site, this time of red sandstone.</p>

<p>The church is mentioned in the Domesday book and so is thought to be of Saxon origin.  The current church is of Norman origin (with modifiications being made in the 14th Century).  The plan of the church forms a cruciform with the tower at the cross point, a less common layout (when compared with the more usual configuration of siting the tower at the east or west end of the building).</p>
<p>The tower is Early English.  At the crossing are four multishafted piers, these are late Norman.  Much of the carving has been lost through adaptation and strengthening, but on one there is a good example of narrow fluting.  The piers support four pointed arches dating from the late 12th Century.  In the west walls of both transepts are blocked half-arches, probably put in anticipation of aisles being added to the nave.  There are walled-up doorways which are also suggestive of plans for future expansion.  At least three major restoration projects were proposed in the 19th Century but it is not clear how fully any of them was executed.</p>
<p>Traces of medieval painting have survived on the apex of the east wall.</p>
<p>The pulpit is Jacobean and is a particularly good example.  The communion rails are dated 1685 and are also notable for the carving - they were reinstated in 1931 having been found in Wrockwardine Hall.  The east window and the windows at the ends of the transepts are by Kempe and others are by O'Connor.  There is also a rococo monument to William Cludde (a prominent local landowner, died 1765), which may be the work of T F Pritchard. The chancel screen was installed in 1913.</p>
<p>An original Norman window in the Chancel was restored in the 19th Century with stained glass depicting Holman Hunt's painting of Christ as The Light of the World.</p>
<p>There are six church bells; two of them are believed to date from the 14th Century, the others mostly from the 17th Century.</p>
<p>There are three fonts in the church; the weathered ancient one in the centre of the church is believed to be pre Norman. A fourth font owned by the church is currently located in the ruins of Old St Chad's Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The ancient parish chest of Wrockwardine, in the north chapel, is believed to date from the 14th Century. It is listed in an inventory of church goods, dated 1686, as 'a coffer with three locks to put the writings in that belong to the poor and charity money when it will come.'  The three locks, which all still work, require separate keys.</p>
<p>The sundial in the churchyard was made in 1750 - a cast-iron base replaced a stone one in 1932.</p>
<p>The name Wrockwardine is derived from the words meaning 'enclosure or settlement by the Wrekin' - Wrekin is the British name for Wroxeter (and is the name given to the nearby hill).</p>

<p>This church is likely more steeped in history than any other in Shropshire.  It is possible there was a Christian basilica on the site in late Roman Wroxeter, and it is likely there was a Saxon church after that.  By the time of the Domesday survey, the church was well established (four priests are mentioned).  The manor was held by Thored at the time of the Norman conquest, but was passed to Sheriff Reginald.  The church was given to Haughmond Abbey in 1155 and finally the college of priests was replaced by a vicar in 1347.</p>
<p>Masonry from the Roman fort of Viroconium was plundered for the construction of the church.  The earliest part of the building (parts of the nave built of Roman masonry) dates from the 7th or 8th Centuries, and into the 8th or 9th Centuries.  The chancel was added in the late 12th Century (late Norman) as was the tower base.  The rest of the tower is late 16th Century.  Set in the upper part of the tower are pieces which may have come from Haughmond Abbey after its dissolution in 1539.  In 1763 the church was modified to remove the old south aisle and replace it with a narrower one and the vestry.</p>
<p>The font is thought to be the inverted base of a Roman column.  The iron bound chest dates from the 14th Century.  The pulpit is Jacobean (17th / 18th Century).  Most of the stained glass is by David Evans of Shrewsbury (19th Century), and there is some medieval stained glass in one of the nave windows.</p>
<p>The earliest tomb chest is Sir Thomas Bromley (died 1555), Chief Justice of England, and his wife.  There is also a memorial to Sir Richard Newport (died 1570) and his wife.  There is also the tomb of John Berker (died 1618j and his wife).  The other monument of note is that for Francis Newport (died 1708), first Earl of Bradford.</p>
<p>The place name is a 'Roman site called Uricon'.  This was the capital of the Cornovii, called Viroconium Cornovorium by the Romans and the name probably referred originally to the hill-fort on the Wrekin and was later transferred to the Roman settlement.  The Romano-British name is perhaps, 'Urico's place', Urico is an unknown place-name and ceaster (Old English) is a city, an old fortification or a Roman site.</p>
