<h2>Listed Buildings</h2>
<p>A building is added to the National <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/">Heritage List for England</a> when it has special architectural or historic interest and so is considered to be of national importance and therefore worth protecting.</p>
<p>Listed buildings come in three categories of 'significance' (in England and Wales):
<ul>
  <li>Grade I - buildings of exceptional interest.</li>
  <li>Grade II* - particularly important buildings of more than special interest.</li>
  <li>Grade II - buildings that are of special interest.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Listing covers a whole building, including the interior, unless parts of it are specifically excluded in the list description.  Because all listed buildings are different and unique, what is actually covered by a listing can vary quite widely.</p>
<p>A scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change.  Designation of a Scheduled Monument is usually given to sites with minimal economic viability: those with no potential for a new use. Listed Building status is only given to above ground structures, meaning Scheduling is the only legal protection available to archaeological sites.</p>
