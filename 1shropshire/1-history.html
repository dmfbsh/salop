<h2>Oxygen Begins to Accumulate in the Earth's Atmosphere</h2>
<p>1,500 millions years ago, oxygen starts being produced - oxygen is made by cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) as a product of photosynthesis. For 2,200 million years this oxygen was removed from the atmosphere as it reacted with iron, sank to the bottom of the sea and became trapped in rock layers. 1,500 million years ago the free iron ran out and oxygen began to be released into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2>Formation of Shropshire Rocks</h2>
<p>The first of Shropshire's rocks are formed 700 to 555 million years ago, creating some of Shropshire's best known hills including the Wrekin, Caer Caradoc and the Long Mynd.  The rocks are part of the Vendian supercontinent (also know as Pannotia) and are located in the southern hemisphere, approximately 60 degrees south of the equator.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the Precambrian supereon the supercontinent of Vendian starts to split (divided by the Iapetus Ocean), the rocks that would become Shropshire are now part of the Gondwana continent.</p>

<p>From circa 538 million years ago to the present day, the planet develops to create the landscape we see today.</p>
<h2>Cambrian Period</h2>
<p>In the Cambrian period, Shropshire moves to 65 degrees south of the equator due to the widening of the Iapetus Ocean.</p>
<h2>Ordovician Period</h2>
<p>At the start of the Ordovician period, Shropshire (along with the rest of Southern Britain) formed part of the north-east margin of Gondwana.  During this period, a rift formed on the margin of the continent, creating the micro continent of Avalonia, and this new continent included Shropshire.  Avalonia starts to move northwards (at a rate of circa 2.4cm per year) as a new ocean (the Rheic Ocean) forms between Avalonia and Gondwana.</p>
<h2>Silurian Period</h2>
<p>The micro continent of Avalonia continued to move north during the Silurian period.  As it moved closer to the equator, the subtropial environment allowed coral reefs to grow on the northern margins of the continent, this resulted in the formation of the famous Much Wenlock limestone, circa 421 to 433 million years ago.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous rock formation in England, the Much Wenlock Limestone is known for its abundance of fossils, many of which were first recorded either in Shropshire or Worcestershire, and are found no-where else in the world.</p>

<h2>Mesolithic Age</h2>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-10">
<p>The Mesolithic Age (or middle Stone Age, circa 10,000 to 4,000 BC) is characterised by a warmer climate that changed the arctic environment to one of pine, birch and alder forest.  The improved climate led to the continuous human occupation of Britain.  The less open landscape was less conducive to the large herds of reindeer and wild horse that had previously sustained humans.  Those animals were replaced in people's diets by pig and less social animals such as elk, red deer, roe deer and wild boar, which would have required different hunting techniques.  Tools changed to incorporate barbs which could snag the flesh of an animal, making it harder for it to escape alive.  Farming was introduced to Britain at the end of Mesolithic Age around 4,500 BC, although hunter-gather ways of life continued it was being replaced by distinct territories occupied by different groups.</p>
<p>By about 6500 BC, rising seas had inundated the land bridge with Europe, making Britain an island.</p>
<p>In Shropshire flint scrapers and other implements from this age, and made out of local pebble flint, have been found primarily in the parishes of Worfield, Claverley and Alveley, along the South East border of the county.</p>

<p>Remains of Bronze Age settlements are not common in Britain and none have been recorded in Shropshire so far.  It is believed that many tribes led a nomadic lifestyle based on cattle and agriculture so did not build structures to last (communities were often based near rivers for transport).  There is evidence, however, of tree clearing at this time to make space for crops.</p>
<p>Tumuli (burial mounds) were built during this time on areas of high ground.  As well as providing a place to inter the cremated remains of their dead, the tumuli may also be where a tribe gathered at certain times of the year for religious purposes.  There are three known stone circles in Shropshire that date from this time at: Mitchell's Fold, Hoarstones and Whetstones (now destroyed).</p>

<p>The capital of the tribe was most probably the Wrekin hill fort.  The first mention of the tribe occurs in the works of Ptolemy in the 2nd Century AD.  The origin of the name Cornovii is unknown, but it may mean 'People of the Horn' referring to a horned god cult followed by the tribe.</p>

<p>Roman civic life continued, but declined (as the cities had lost their central function as centres for taxation and administration) and by about 450 AD the Roman economic system had broken down. Many of the Roman buildings at Viroconium Cornoviorum fall into disrepair and there is a substantial rebuilding programme in timber - who instigated this rebuilding is unknown, possibly a bishop.</p>

<h2>Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain Begins</h2>
<p>England is subject to successive invasions of Germanic tribesmen (Angles, Saxons and Jutes). Originally settling in eastern England, they moved progressively west as more arrived.</p>
<p>The Cornovian tribal area is under the rule of the Kingdom of Pengwern (little is known about Pengwern and how it came about, although according to Welsh tradition it was part of the Welsh kingdom of Powys). Early Powys, much larger in extent than the later medieval kingdom, is thought to have roughly coincided with the territory of the Cornovii tribe whose civitas capital or administrative centre was Viroconium Cornoviorum.</p>
<p>It is possible that the area of Shrewsbury was first settled in the 5th Century by refugees from Wroxeter. Also, at this time the king of Powys may have moved his court to the same area to resist the encroaching Anglian advances.</p>
<p>Wroxeter’s abandonment as a settlement cannot be precisely dated, however, but may have occurred in the mid sixth century, when a 'Great Plague' is known to have swept through Britain, or possibly in the seventh century, when the Anglo-Saxons took control of the region.</p>

<p>It is also thought that the Pengwern participated in the battle, as allies of Penda.</p>

<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-10">
<h2>Integration with Mercia</h2>
<p>Evidence of Anglo-Saxon settlement in Shropshire is rare before the 7th Century.</p>
<p>Following a period of military alliance with Mercian rulers, particularly King Penda, Pengwern was absorbed by neighbouring Mercia after 642 AD (and the battle of Maserfield). The local Cornovian people may have continued to reside in the area, perhaps as the Wrekensaete, under Mercian rule.</p>
<p>It is likely that the Cornovii territory was partitioned and ruled by different princes, probably perpetuated in the ancient boundaries between the dioceses of Lichfield and Hereford.</p>
<p>Eventually, the northern part of Shropshire was part of the Anglo-Saxon territory of Wreocensaete (sometimes anglicised to Wrekinsets, the name approximates to Wrekin-dwellers) and the southern part of Shropshire probably belonged to the Magonsaete (a minor sub-kingdom of the greater Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia).</p>
<p>The northern and southern parts of Shropshire were absorbed into the Saxon kingdom of Mercia by King Offa (Offa ruled Mercia from 757 to 796). In 765 AD he constructed Watt’s Dyke to defend his territory against the Welsh, and in 779 AD, having pushed across the River Severn, drove the Welsh King of Powys from Shrewsbury, he secured his conquests by a second defensive earthwork known as Offa’s Dyke.</p>
<p>The name &quot;Mercia&quot; is Old English for &quot;boundary folk&quot;.</p>
<p>Shrewsbury was probably founded as a town in the 8th Century by the Saxon rulers of Mercia, who needed a fortified burh to control the Severn river-crossing on the road between the burhs of Hereford and Chester.</p>

<h2>Mercia converts to Christianity in the latter part of the 7th Century AD.</h2>
<p>The first kings of Mercia were pagans, and they resisted the encroachment of Christianity longer than other kingdoms in the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy.</p>
<p>Mercian rulers remained resolutely pagan until the reign of Peada in 656. The first appearance of Christianity in Mercia, however, had come at least thirty years earlier, following the Battle of Cirencester of 628, when Penda incorporated the formerly West Saxon territories of Hwicce into his kingdom, but Penda remained Pagan until his death.  Penda respected the Christians and even allowed them to operate more widely in Mercia.  However, not much progress was made in converting the nobles and people of Mercia.</p>
<p>The diocese of Mercia was founded in 656 by Diuma (the first Bishop of Mercia).</p>
<p>In 669 AD, the King of Mercia, Wulfhere, had requested a new bishop, as Mercia was without one following the death of the previous incumbent, Chad was dispatched by the Archbishop.  And so, after an inconclusive start, decisive steps to Christianise Mercia were being taken; Chad was the fifth bishop to minister to the Mercians and is credited with introducing Christianity to the Mercian kingdom.  Wulfhere gave Chad land to build a monasterary at Lichfield.</p>
<p>However, Mercia did not survive long as an ecclesiastical entity.  From 676 AD the Archbishop adopted a policy of appointing bishops to much smaller tribal groups within the kingdoms, thus covering smaller areas—closer in size to those found in other West European countries.  Hence, a bishopric (diocese) was established at Hereford (in 676 AD - one of the oldest in England) for the Magonsæte sub-kingdom (and the existing Lichfield diocese covered Wreocansaete).</p>

<h2>Danelaw is Established</h2>
<p>The Vikings had been raiding Britain since 792 AD, but being so far west, this had little impact on Shropshire until Danelaw was established.</p>
<p>Danelaw is established in 878 AD which divides Britain into the Anglo-Saxon south and the Danish north.</p>
<p>Although not part of the Danelaw, the area that is now known as Shropshire was regularly overrun by Danish raiders in the 9th and 10th Centuries, as the eastern part of Mercia had been seized by the Danes. In 874 the Danes destroyed the famous priory of Wenlock.</p>

<h2>The end of Mercia</h2>
<p>The final Mercian king died in 879 AD.  From about 883 to 911 AD Mercia was ruled by a Mercian Lord under the overlorship of Wessex.  Thus, the Kingdom of Mercia appears to have lost its political independence and was ruled by the kings of Wessex.  The last reference to Mercia by name is in the annal for 1017 AD, when Eadric Streona was awarded the government of Mercia by Cnut.  The Mercians as a people are last mentioned in the annal for 1049 AD.</p>
<p>Mercia was mapped out into shires in the 10th century after its recovery from the Danes by Edward the Elder (King of the Anglo-Saxons).</p>
<p>The first mention of &quot;Shropshire&quot; in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle occurs under 1006 - this is when the King crossed the Thames and wintered in the area of Shropshire.</p>
<p>Thirteen years before the Norman Conquest, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle relates that in 1053 the Welshmen slew a great many of the English wardens at Westbury, and in that year the English king ordered that any Welshman found beyond Offa's Dyke within the English shire should have his right hand cut off.</p>
<p>In the Domesday Survey, Earl Godwin, Sweyn, Harold, Queen Edith, Edward the Confessor and Edwin and Morcar (these are earls, kings and queens from Wessex and Mercia) are mentioned as having held lands in the county shortly before or during the Norman Conquest.</p>

<p>The castle was chosen as the seat of the Council in the Marches of Wales and so was effectively the capital of Wales.  Consequently, the castle was renovated throughout the 16th Century.</p>
<p>With the castle being besieged and taken by Parliamentary forces during the English Civil War and following the abolition of the Council in 1689 (after it had been restored following the English Civil War), the castle fell into neglect.</p>

After her martyrdom, Winefride continued to live a holy life first as a hermit and then as a nun at Gwytherin, a remote place in Denbighshire.</p>
<p>In Shrewsbury, the abbey church was ready for consecration by 1130 but did not have any holy relics and the monks were envious of the many said to be in Wales.  The monks of Shrewsbury began negotiations to obtain the relics of St Winefride for their abbey.  With the consent of the Bishop of Bangor Herebert, the Abbot of Shrewsbury dispatched Prior Robert and another monk called Richard to Wales to obtain St Winefride's relics.  The relics of St Winefride were finally translated to the Abbey on 19th September 1138.  The shrine of Saint Winefride in Shrewsbury Abbey became a popular place of pilgrimage.  The shrine of Saint Winefride at Shrewsbury was destroyed in the reformation.  A fragment possibly of the shrine or of a reredos was recorded by the Rev. Blakeway in the early nineteenth century.</p>

The chapel was a small sandstone structure approximately 15 metres long, consisting of chancel and nave divided by a stone screen. Today, the remains of the chapel are located in the Telford Town Park.</p>
<p>The chapel had become a ruin by the 18th Century, probably before 1786, when Rev Williams produced a painting of the ruins. In 1909, the ruin was bought by Edward Parry, vicar of Malinslee, who proposed to restore it as a place of worship to designs by W. A. Webb, but nothing came of this. When Malinslee Hall was demolished in 1971 to make way for the new Telford Town Centre, the chapel was dismantled by the Telford Development Corporation and later re-assembled in the nearby Telford Town Park.</p>

<p>The origins of the castle are uncertain but it was probably built in the 13th century by Fulk FitzWarin (a prominent representative of a marcher family associated especially with estates in Shropshire) during the reign of Richard I.</p>
<p>The main purpose of its construction appears to have been as a barrier to stop the Welsh onslaught and to retain control of the passes along the river Severn.</p>
<p>It is thought that the castle was razed by Llewellyn the Great in 1223, only to be rebuilt three years later in 1226, this time with a stone wall surrounding the bailey. A few years later the Sheriff of Shropshire ejected Fulk FitzWarin from the castle and took over his lands citing FitzWarin's utterances he made as a renunciation of fealty. However, Fitzwarin was able to retake his lands and his manor through the law. The FitzWarin family retained possession of the castle, although they moved their seat of power to Whittington after they secured it as a stronghold, until the mid fourteenth century, when it may have been abandoned.</p>

<img class="imgl" src="assets/images/history/2019-09-01_13_35_07_DSC_4992.jpg" align="right">
<p>The infirmary was constructed by the then owner of Tong castle as part remedy for a fine imposed on his father who rebelled against King John.  When the church and college was built in the 15th Century, the infirmary was incorporated into the college and enabled 13 alms people to be housed and looked after by the college priests.  After the Dissolution the infirmary remained as an Alms House, they were later demolished in 1764.</p>

<img class="imgr" src="assets/images/history/2021-06-05_15_22_55_DSC_9570.jpg" align="left">
<p>Ashfield Hall is an historic house, consisting of two distinct portions. The left-hand side is the original 15th Century structure of coursed stone rubble with stone dressings, and the right-hand of timber frame and plaster was added late in the 16th Century.</p>
<p>The site was originally the site of St John's hospital, founded in the 13th Century for 'lost and naked beggars'.  The building was occupied in the 15th Century as the private house of the Ashfield family.  Later it was called the Blue Bridge Inn from the bridge over a stream that ran in front.  Charles I is believed to have stayed here in 1642 on his way from Shrewsbury to Oxford.</p>

<p>It is believed that the castle was founded in the 12th century as a motte and bailey castle by one of the de Optons as a mesne lord of the Says of Clun Castle.  The family was politically significant, Sir Walter de Opton being Sheriff of the large, adjacent counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire.</p>
<p>It is most probable that Walter de Opton (over time becoming de Hopton) built the stone castle during the Barons' War of the 1260s.  The bailey was fortified in stone and the rectangular two-storey keep was built.</p>
<p>The last Walter Hopton died during the Wars of the Roses in the 15th century and the castle passed by marriage to the Corbet family of Moreton Corbet castle.</p>

<p>Dafydd ap Gruffydd was the last native Prince of Wales before the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1283.</p>
<p>On 30 September 1283, Dafydd ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales, was condemned to death, the first person known to have been tried and executed for what from that time onwards would be described as high treason against the King. Edward ensured that Dafydd's death was slow and agonising, and also historic; he became the first prominent person in recorded history to have been hanged, drawn and quartered.  Dafydd was dragged through the streets of Shrewsbury attached to a horse's tail, then hanged alive, revived, then disembowelled and his entrails burned before him for ‘his sacrilege in committing his crimes in the week of Christ's passion’, and then his body cut into four-quarters ‘for plotting the king's death’.  Geoffrey of Shrewsbury was paid 20 shillings for carrying out the gruesome act on 3 October 1283.</p>

A benefit only extended to trusted people, Burnell as a friend and advisor to King Edward I, was granted a royal licence to crenellate and fortify the manor.</p>
<p>In the Autumn of 1283, it is believed that Edward I held a Parliament at Acton Burnell - this is significant because it was the first time in English history that the law making process included the Commons.  The law passed became known as the Statute of Acton Burnell, a law giving protection to creditors, indicating the increasing significance of traders during those times.</p>

<p>The gatehouse was added in 1640-1641, just before the English Civil War.  At that time Stokesay was owned by William Craven, the first Earl of Craven and supporter of the king.  The Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, the castle was besieged and the Royalist garrison was forced to surrender.  The castle was ordered to be slighted by Parliament, but only minor damage was done allowing it to continue as a residence.</p>

<h2>Black Death</h2>
<p>The Black Death (a bubonic plague pandemic), reached England in June 1348.  It was the first and most severe manifestation of the second pandemic.  The term Black Death was not used until the late 17th century.</p>
<p>Originating in Asia, it spread west along the trade routes across Europe and arrived on the British Isles from the English province of Gascony.  The plague was spread by flea-infected rats, as well as individuals who had been infected on the continent.</p>
<p>Nash was a village in Shropshire which is believed to have been wiped out entirely by the Black Death.  It now no longer exists and is described as a lost settlement, deserted medieval village or abandoned village.</p>
<p>The 1349 manorial income for Nash (also referred to as Nesse) indicates that the village was unable to pay any monies &quot;because the inhabitants are dead&quot;.  Despite this, the village was home to a farmer called Hercules Felton in 1668 and it had three people paying hearth tax by 1672, and a single barn remained by 1839, suggesting that some human life remained in the area.</p>
<p>Nash has been completely deserted since at least the mid-19th century and the old site is located in the middle of fields near Wrockwardine, though no road or footpath survives to provide access to the area.  A small wood near Drummery Lane marks the location where the foundations of house platforms are speculated to lie but no excavations have ever been conducted on the site of the lost village.</p>

<p>The earliest reference to the mill and its surrounding land appears around the late 15th Century, when it was known as Donynges or Dunnings Mill.  The property was originally part of the Pitchford estate of the Ottley family, who owned much of the land in Bridgnorth and surrounding parishes.  The mill remained in the hands of the Pitchford estate until the 18th Century.  In the early centuries the mill was probably worked by an itinerant journeyman miller – someone who would visit the mill only when there was work to be done.</p>
<p>The mill has been enlarged and altered several times.  The earliest known resident millers, the Crowther family, enlarged the mill and likely built proper living accommodation at that time, though the mill could have also been enlarged prior to their involvement.  It is likely the first enlargement would have taken place around the early 17th Century, when land was obtained to construct the upper pool.</p>
<p>The present wheel was originally cast at Coalbrookdale in 1854, installed around the middle of the 19th Century and replaced an earlier wheel on the same site.  Documents show that as early as 1843 a steam engine had been purchased to work in conjunction with the present wheel.</p>
<p>The mill has the largest cast iron waterwheel in England, spanning a 38 feet (12 m) diameter.</p>

<p>In the 16th Century, Nescliffe Hill became a rendezvous for highway robbers. The wooded hill probably provided an excellent place from which to surprise travellers on the main Oswestry to Shrewsbury road. The most famous of these highwaymen was the outlaw 'Wild Humphrey' Kynaston, who was outlawed for his part in the murder of a man at Little Stretton. He is reputed to have lived in this cave. Legend tells us that Humphrey Kynaston assumed the role of a Shropshire 'Robin Hood', robbing the rich and helping the poor. He is said to have owned an impressive horse, capable of leaping over men, gates and on one occasion a gaping hole in the bridge over the River Severn at Montford. Wild Humphrey was pardoned in 1516 and died peacefully in 1534.</p>
<p>The cave was lived in until at least the 18th Century when a family of nine was raised in what must have been very primitive conditions.</p>
<p>Nawadays the cave is a home for bats which breed and hibernate in deep crevices in the rocks.</p>

<p>Although Much Wenlock received a charter from the King in 1468, local order was in the hands of the powerful Abbot of Wenlock Priory.  The Guildhall was built to provide a court (which remained in use until 1985) when the Priory was dissolved.  A Council Chamber was added in 1577.</p>
<p>The chambers are furnished with carved oak panels from a local manor house (installed in 1848) - no one knows which manor house or how they were available.</p>

<h2>The English Civil War</h2>
<p>In 1642, relations between the King (Charles I) and Parliament were so strained that civil war was the only way to resolved the differences.  The king raised his standard at Nottingham on August 22nd.  On the 20th September he reached Wellington, where before his whole Army he</p>
<p>made the well-known proclamation  to his people that he would preserve the Protestant Religion, the laws of England and the liberty of Parliament, and on the following day he fixed his headquarters at Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>On the 28th September, the king informed the gentlemen of the county that he had sent for a mint, the workers of which arrived a few days afterwards.  The mint establishment which he had commanded to come was that of Aberystwith, which had been established there in 1637 by letters patent to Thomas Bushell, and on the 21st October the first coins were issued.  The period during which the mint was active was only three months, at the end of December the King moved his headquarters to Oxford, and the mint followed him, reaching there on the 3rd January.</p>

<p>On 31st March 1646 during the Civil War, Bridgnorth was under siege from Parliamentary forces - the Royalists retreated to the castle after setting fire to the stables in Listley Street.  The fire soon spread to burn down many buildings in High Town.  It was the incendiary torches fired from the castle that ignited St. Leonards Church, burning all the town records that were stored in the church.  By 1st April 1646 most of Bridgnorth High Town was destroyed by the great fire.</p>
<p>After three weeks of continued attack on the castle Colonel Lavington took charge of getting a team of Parliamentary forces to dig a 70 foot tunnel under Castle Hill.  Knowing that the Royalists stored their gunpowder in St Marys Church, his aim was to blow up the church.</p>
<p>69 feet of tunnel was dug into the rock face but was not completed as the Royalists surrendered on Sunday 26th April 1646.</p>

<p>Benbow joined the navy aged 25 years, seeing action against Algerian pirates before leaving and joining the merchant navy where he traded until the Glorious Revolution of 1688, whereupon he returned to the Royal Navy and was commissioned. Benbow fought against France during the Nine Years War, serving on and later commanding several vessels. He went on to achieve fame during campaigns against pirates and fighting in the West Indies against France during the War of the Spanish Succession.</p>
<p>Benbow's fame and success earned him both public notoriety and a promotion to admiral.  He was then involved in an incident during the action of August 1702, where a number of his captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did not live to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture, including Treasure Island - the Admiral Benbow is the tavern where Jim Hawkins and his mother live.</p>

<p>Robert Cadman was an 18th Century steeplejack and ropeslider, between 1732 and 1739 he performed feats of daring by sliding or flying down a rope from St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury to the Gay Meadow across the River Severn. Cadman walked some 250 metres up the rope that connected the 68-metre-high spire of St Mary's Church with an anchor in the ground in Gay Meadow. Climbing up the rope across the River Severn, he performed tricks on the way. When at the top, near the pinnacle of the spire, he donned a wooden breastplate with a central groove and hurtled to earth along the rope.</p>
<p>On 2nd February 1739 he fell to his death when the rope broke. He was buried in St Mary's Church.</p>

<p>Badger Dingle was created by Isaac Hawkins Browne in the 1780s and ‘90s.  He constructed a new mansion, Badger Hall (demolished 1950s), to the designs of James Wyatt whilst at the same time employing William Emes, and probably his associate John Webb, to create a pleasure ground.  Lakes were created in the valley bottom and a circuit walk took visitors through the ‘ornamented cultivated side’ of the valley, which looked across to the ‘purely sylvan’ scene of the opposite bank.  An early account describes a picturesque scene of  alpine planting and colourful shrubs.</p>
<p>Throughout the century it was open to tourists, but by 1890 public days were restricted and visitors had to apply in advance to the then owner, Col. Capel Cure.  Soon after visitors were banned; their habit of digging up flowers and ferns was no longer to be tolerated and Badger Dingle was closed to the public ‘on account of the ravages of depredators’.</p>

<img class="imgr" src="assets/images/history/2023-04-30_11_40_41_DSC03493.jpg" align="left">
<p>In the evening of 23rd October 1799, a ferry boat carrying 43 Coalport China Factory workers started out to cross the River Severn between Jackfield and Colaport in the dark and thick fog.</p>
<p>Halfway across the river the ferry capsized and 28 men, women and children drowned. The 43 workers had left the china works at 9pm after an extra shift and walked alongside the canal to a ferry boat provided by Richard Reynolds to cross the Severn to the south bank to get to their homes in Jackfield and Broseley.</p>
<p>Mr. Rose of Rose and Company, had previously closed the china works at Caughley and Broseley and amalgamated the work forces to work at a new works in Coalport, hence the need for a passage or ferry boat.</p>

<h3>The Rotunda, Ironbridge</h3>
<img class="imgl" src="assets/images/history/2020-07-31_07_54_03_DSC_7748.jpg" align="right">
<p>Viewpoint and site of the Rotunda, which was a folly built by Richard Reynolds (who was a Quaker, philanthropista and partner in the ironworks at Coalbrookdale) in the 1790s as part of the &quot;Sabbath walks&quot; designed to take in the spectacular views of the gorge.  It was particularly for use by his workforce, but it was also used by visitors to the area.  It was demolished in February 1804, following the departure of Reynolds from the area a year earlier.  The rotunda was described by Joshua Gilpin (an American merchant and manufacturer who toured industrial Britain at the very end of the eighteenth century) in 1796 as a round temple of about 10 feet diameter with 'pillars of cast iron hollows' and in 1801 an unknown person refers to the rotunda as being supported by '9 iron pillars' - it was a circular structure a bit like a bandstand, inside it had revolving seat.</p>

<p>In 1791 in Ellesmere a plan was proposed by a small group of industrialists who owned coal mines, iron mines and other works for a canal network to link the rivers Mersey and Severn. The hub was to be Ellesmere. Birch House was constructed to serve as the main office. From here Thomas Telford designed the tunnels, wharfs, moorings, locks and ‘rivers in the sky’. However the canal was never finished as intended due to the project’s rising costs and the failure to generate the expected commercial traffic.</p>

<p>William Penny Brookes was an English surgeon, magistrate, botanist, and educationalist.  He established the Olympian Class of his Wenlock Agricultural Reading Society in 1850 to inspire local people to keep fit and take part in sports competitions.  Following the 1860 games, the Olympian Class was set up as the independent Wenlock Olympian Society.</p>
<p>Brookes' campaign for physical education brought him into contact with Baron Pierre de Coubertin - in 1890, the young French aristocrat visited Much Wenlock and stayed with Dr Brookes at his lifelong home in Wilmore Street.  Coubertin was inspired by discussions with Brookes and a games staged for his visit - in 1894 Coubertin set up the International Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>Consequently, Dr Brookes is credited as a founding father of the modern Olympic Games, and one of the Olympic mascots for London 2012 was named Wenlock after the town.</p>

<p>The first crossing of the river at Coalport was based on timber framed arches built on stone abutments and opened in 1780.  The opening was played down to not overshadow the showcase iron bridge further up the river.  The wooden bridge was destroyed by flooding in 1795.  The bridge was rebuilt in 1799, with brick, timber and cast iron parts.  By 1817 the bridge was failing again, and so the bridge was completely rebuilt in iron in 1818.</p>

<p>In September 1941 a radar station was set up on Titterstone Clee (RAF Clee Hill), which housed 40-50 personnel.  Initially, the crew lived in huts on the hill, but from 1956 the crew were allowed to board in Ludlow due to the cold conditions in winter.  The station was closed in 1957, and was then reactivated in 1964 by the CAA.  The larger of the radar arrays is now part of the NATS radar network.  The smaller of the two is a Met Office weather radar station.</p>

<p>Apley Castle was a magnificent Georgian mansion house (similar to Attingham Park) and centrepiece of a 900 acre estate.  However, it became too expensive to maintain and so in 1955 the house was dismantled and the contents sold off.</p>
<p>Plans for the new house to replace the old house were approved in October 1791.  Costing 4622 pounds and 8 shillings, the contract stipulated that &quot;The bricks to be made on the estate. Anything required to be taken from the old house, which at the same time is to be turned into the stables and outhouses.&quot;</p>
<p>The mansion was of the Georgian style with tall Corinthian pillars to its entrance porch, from which a drive of considerable length led to the town of Wellington.</p>
<p>Throughout the 19th century members of the family that owned the estate (the Charltons) distinguished themselves as soldiers in the Indian Wars and in the Crimea.  Whilst serving in India, Captain St. John Chiverton Charlton, an able botanist, is credited with the discovery of the tea plant, whose subsequent cultivation contributed much to the economic development of India.</p>
