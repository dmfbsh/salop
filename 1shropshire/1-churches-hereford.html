<p>This church is considered to be the finest Early English (13th Century) church in Shropshire.  Unlike most English parish churches, Acton Burnell is built in a same style throughout.</p>
<p>It features a corbel-table with many grotesque carvings (a corbel-table is a continuous row of corbels, and a corbel is a block of stone projecting from a wall and supporting some heavy feature).</p>
<p>The font is considered to be the finest Early English font in Shropshire.  In the south wall of the chancel is a double piscina.  In the north transept are medieval encaustic tiles and some impressive monuments.  The tomb chest is to Sir Nicholas Burnell (died 1382), on it is what is considered to be the finest memorial brass in Shropshire.  The other large monuments are to Sir Richard Lee (died 1591) and Sir Humphrey Lee (died 1632).</p>
<p>Acton generally means 'settlement (farm or estate) by the oaks' and this estate belonged to Robert Burnell an English bishop who served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1274 to 1292.</p>

<p>This is a church that has suffered at the hands of 19th Century restorers.  Much of the masonry is medieval, but the windows were all renewed in the 19th Century.  The porch was added in 1722 and the north chapel in 1820.</p>
<p>Acton generally means 'settlement (farm or estate) by the oaks' and the 'Scott' originates from the medieval name Reynold le. Scot who held a share in the manor in 1255.</p>
<p>The settlement was registered as Actune in the Domesday Book.</p>

<h3>Alberbury - St Michael</h3>

<img class="imgr" src="assets/images/churches/2021-04-17_14_50_05_DSC_9432.jpg" alt="" align="left">
<p>The church is thought to have been founded between the 7th and 10th Centuries.  It was originally a Minster Church (Minster was the Anglo-Saxon version of a monastery, and was originally applied to churches served by monks / clergy living a communal life and endowed by a charter with the obligation of maintaining the daily office of prayer, but was not the seat of a bishop and the church had no diocesan responsibilities).</p>
<p>In the mid-12th century the church was given Shrewsbury Abbey, but was later assigned to Alberbury Priory.  The priory was founded in 1228 and was one of three dependencies of the French abbey of Grandmont (the priory itself was sited about one and a quarter miles away by the river Severn).  Being an 'alien' priory it was vulnerable to predators representing the king, the priory was finally suppressed by the king in 1441 and the estate passed to All Souls' college, Oxford.</p>
<p>The church was reconsecrated in 1290, following the cessation of a long-running series of Welsh border disputes.</p>
<p>The tower is Early English (approx. 1180 to 1270), it has a saddleback roof (a ridge and two sloping sides) - the only example of such in Shropshire.</p>
<p>The roof of the nave is thought to be one of the finest in the county.</p>
<p>The Loton Chapel was added in 1320, and contains a pre-Raphaelite window by Burne Jones.</p>
<p>There are two wall-monuments to Sir Richard Lyster, who was MP for Shrewsbury in the 18th Century, the imagery on one refers to a scene in the House of Commons when he protested against a decision of the House.</p>
<p>The place name derives from the Old English 'burh' (a fortified place) and the personal name Aluburg or Ealhburg.</p>

<p>The entrance and tower are of timber and the walls are built of local stone, carried from a quarry at the enterance to the Batch Valley.</p>
<p>The church was the ambition of the rector of Church Stretton.  He bought the land and gave it to the people of All Stretton.  Throughout 1901 money was raised in the village to pay for the building and by the end of the year sufficient had been raised to enable work to start.</p>
<p>On the wall hangs a straw hat linking St Michaels with the African village of Lesotho.</p>
<p>The font was made and presented by Joseph Jones Stone Mason of Church Stretton 1903.</p>
<p>The name Stretton is derived from the Old English words straet meaning 'Roman road' and tun meaning settlement.  The affix All derives from an early owner called Alfred, rather than from a supposed comment made by King James I of England. The local tale describes how he passed first through Little Stretton, then Church Stretton and finally as he came through All Stretton the king declared &quot;They're All Strettons around here!&quot;.</p>

<p>The chancel is spacious and a good example of mid-13th Century design.  The nave has strange stone corbels which are 15th Century, the clerestory windows are also from this period.  The whole arcade may be dated to about 1180.  The south chapel is 14th Century and is known as the Coton Chantry Chapel.  The tower arch is a good example of Norman work dated 1150.  The church was restored in 1878-79 by Sir Arthur Blomfeld.</p>
<p>There are six bells founded by Thomas Roundhall of Gloucester in 1779.</p>
<p>On the south wall of the chapel is a late 14th Centurn wall painting, discovered during the restiration of 1879.  It portrays good over evil, and shows a woman wearing a crown, with a skeleton of sin or death or her right, holding a sheaf of darts in one hand, and thrusting a spear through her heart with the other.  On her left is a herald with a trumpet, and a man putting two dragons to flight with his sword.</p>
<p>Much of stained glass is by Kempe, including the east window and the chapel windows. One of the clorestory windows is 15th Century, depicting annuciation, St Anthony and a Bishop.</p>
<p>In the chapel is an ancient stone altar, with five consecration crosses, a carved piscine, and medieval tiles with grotesque animals.  The painted reredos is by Kempe, and unusual as it is painted on zinc, it shows the nativity, the crucifixion and the descent from the cross.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement has Saxon origins, derived from Alve or Aelfythe (a personal name) and Ley (a forest clearing, Old English), and is listed in the Domesday Book as Alvidelege.</p>

<p>The present building dates from Norman times - there are blocked Norman doorways in the south and north side of the aisle, there are also Norman windows in the chancel.  Originally it was a dependent chapelry of Bromfield Priory.</p>
<p>Beneath the bell turret are two benefactions boards.</p>
<p>There are several monuments, the most interesting of which is that to Jonathan Green (died 1792), consisting of two urns in front of an obelisk (it is the work of Williams Humphries Stephens of Worcester).</p>
<p>The church is very close to the river Teme, in fact the chancel collapsed during reconstruction in 1904-1907.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means 'Ash-tree ford'.  Henri de Boulers was a tenant 1211-2.  Aesc is the Anglian for an ash tree, ford is Old English (meaning a ford).</p>

<p>Although of 12th Century origin, the church did not become a separate parish until 1880, prior to that it was a perpetual curacy of Little Hereford.  The original 12th Century building was smaller than the present one, the chancel was extended to the east and the nave to the west probably in the 13th Century.  This was revealed during the restoration of 1882-83, as the original foundations were shallower (only one foot); also, behind the plaster there was different masonry.</p>
<p>The oak belfry was added in the 15th Century.  The gallery was added in the 18th Century.  The parish chest probably dates from this time.  The unusual arrangement of windows, which includes a Vesica windows, was restored in the 19th Century.  The vesica piscis (literally fish's bladder) had the same meaning for the early Church as the symbol of the fish, the Greek word for fish is ichthus and is composed of the initial letters of the Greek for 'Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour'.  A vesica window is rare in English parish churches, during the restoration two Norman windows were revealed and above them the stones which were part of the ancient vesica window.</p>
<p>The carved ends of the oak benches are all different and replaced the box pews.</p>
<p>There is a yew tree which is certified as being 1500 years old (the certificate from 1989 is signed by David Bellamy, naturalist; Allen Meredith, Arboriculturist; Robert Hardy, Longbow enthusiast; and Robert Runcie, the then Archbishop of Canterbury), this suggests that there was an earlier structure here either Saxon or even pre-Christian.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means 'Ash-tree ford'.  It was held by John Carbonel in 1221.  Aesc is the Anglian for an ash tree, ford is Old English (meaning a ford).</p>

<p>The church was consecrated on 14th October in 1138 AD by the Bishop of Hereford, it is mainly Norman with Anglo-Saxon roots.  There is Roman tufa stone in the walls.</p>
<p>The tower and west front were built in 1857.  The north wall of the nave is Norman.  The south wall of the nave is Victorian.  The chancel is dated 1633 (the date being on the east gable).  It is notable that the window tracery is Decorated not Perpendicular.</p>
<p>The chancel’s hammer beam roof rests on corbels carved with a lion, a unicorn, a phoenix and a Pegasus.  The panelling is 17th Century.   The pulpit is dated 1633.</p>
<p>In the east window is a small panel of stained glass from the early 13th Century, it shows a figure of Christ under a canopy - thought to be one of the earliest appearances of a canopy in stained glass.</p>
<p>The church also houses a maiden's garland (a heart shaped wooden frame decorated with gloves, cloth and ribbons).  The one at Astley Abbotts has a ribbon-like piece of paper saying, in still legible handwriting, that it commemorates a young woman, Hannah Phillips, who drowned in the river Severn shortly before her wedding.</p>
<p>The font is lead lined and possibly medieval.</p>
<p>In the churchyard is a memorial known as the lion grave to John Phillips, a surgeon.  There are many stories about this grave, the most popular being that he was mauled to death by a lion that escaped from the circus (and they are buried together).  Alternatively, he had ideas above his station and took the lion as his heraldic symbol.</p>
<p>The name of settlement is from the Old English for 'East wood/clearing', in relation to Morville.  It was held by the abbots of Shrewsbury Abbey.</p>

<p>The original Deed reads: Know all men who are and who shall be, that on the day of dedication of the church of Eston, I Robert, son of Aherius, gave to God and the Chapel of the same vill of Eston one virgate of land containing sixty acres and the whole tithe of my demesne of the same vill and one manse for the health of my soul and all my predecessors and successors.  And that my be gift be free and equit of all reclaim by me and by my heirs and may ever remain firm and stable, I have corroborated it with present writing and the impression of my seal.</p>
<p>Witnesses to the Deed include the Bishop of Herefore, the Prior of Wenlock and the Lord of the Manor of Upton Cressett.</p>
<p>The Tympanum is considered one of the best examples of early Norman sculpture in the county.  It is of Christ's entry into Jerusalem, and is thought to be of the Hereford School.</p>
<p>The oak door and ironwork dates from around 1636.  The three east windows were added in the second half of the 19th Century.  The pulpit is thought to be Jacobean.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the Chancel arch is Norman or Transitional and the panelling in the Chancel may be from the Elizabethan or Georgian period.</p>
<p>There are no graves at the church becase after Robert Fitz Aer died, his hier is known to have been in dispute with the monks of Shrewsbury Abbey (who owned the priory at Morville), over the right to bury the men of Eston in their own village.  The Abbot of Salop decided in favour of the Abbey.</p>
<p>The name of the settlemt derives from the Old English for 'East farm/settlement' (east and tun).  It was held by Robert son of Aer (Fitz Aer) in 1212.  Previously, the village was distinguished by the affix Wheaten, meaning 'growing with wheat'.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the parishes of Badger and Beckbury formed a detached area of the diocese of Hereford, reflecting the historical association of these parishes with Wenlock Priory.  It was in 1905, that Badger was placed in the diocese of Lichfield.</p>
<p>There was a medieval church on the site, but it was demolished and replaced by the current building in 1834.  The architect was Francis Helley.  The church is simply a rectangular preaching area, with no separation between nave and chancel - 1834 is a late date for this arrangement.  The north chapel was added in 1886 (architect F Francis).</p>
<p>In the churchyard is the remains of the a medieval village cross.</p>
<p>The screen was moved to its present position when the north chapel was built, it is late Perpendicular.</p>
<p>There are some notable memorials, the seated figure is Isaac Hawkins Browne (18th Century politician and poet) by Sir Francis Chantrey.</p>
<p>The recent window is a memorial to Dr Margaret Dix (a neuro-otologist).</p>
<p>The name of the place means Baecg’s ridge, from a personal name the Old English ofer meaning the tip of a promontory or a flat topped ridge.</p>

<p>The church was originally built as a chapel to Wenlock Abbey.  The date of origin of its chancel is uncertain; it has been suggested that this was as early as the 8th century, but it is more likely that it originated in the 11th century.  The Norman nave dates from about 1100, and probably replaced an earlier timber nave.  The lower parts of the tower date from later in the 12th century.  A brick south porch was built in 1705, and the brick top stage of the tower and its pyramidal roof were added during the 18th century.  The church was restored in 1851-52 and in 1894-95 the north chapel was built to replace a chapel dating from 1688.</p>
<p>The font is likely to be 12th Century.  The chancel arch is Anglo-Saxon in origin, but it was altered during the restoration.  The church also has a rare ornamental tympanum.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement is from the Old English bearu meaning a a grove (a wood of limited extent).</p>

<p>Richard's Castle is a large parish that straddles the border between Shropshire and Herefordshire; the original church is in Herefordshire, but by the end of the 19th Century this church needed extensive restoration.  The architect Richard Norman Shaw was engaged to design a new church, the selected site was at Batchcott (just in Shropshire).</p>
<p>The church is built of local stone, faced with blocks from Grinshill.</p>
<p>The font is from the old church.</p>
<p>There is one bell in the  tower, which weights 2 tons - this is the largest bell in the diocese.</p>
<p>The reredos was painted by Charles Edgar Buckeridge.</p>
<p>The settlement 'Richard's castle', was built by and is called after Richard Fitz Scrob, a favourite of Edward the Confessor.  The name Batchcott is unknown.</p>

<p>At the time of the Domesday Book, the settlement was most likely part of the manor at Much Wenlock.  During the Middle Ages, there was a chapel at Benthall which was dedicated to St Brice, and which was dependent on Wenlock Priory.</p>
<p>The chapel was destroyed in the Civil War and the present church was built to replace it.  The church is considered to be a fine example of a restoration era (the post Civil War Stuart period) church. The church was extended in the late 19th Century.</p>
<p>There is a vertical sun dial on the church with an eye constructed of glass tesserae.</p>
<p>St Bartholomew was the patron saint of bees.  At one time a bee hive was kept in the church, the honey was sold or given away to help the poor of the community.  The bees used to access the hive through the mouth of the lion's head carving which is just beneath the sun dial.</p>
<p>The place-name means 'nook of land where the bent-grass grows', this derives from the Old English 'beonet' whicn means bent-grass and 'halh' (Anglian) which means a nook of land, a small valley, dry ground in marsh, or a piece of land projecting from, or detached from, the main area of its administrative unit.</p>

<p>The entry in the Domesday Book suggests that there was a Saxon church here.  The present church dates from the 13th Century, with additions and alterations in the following two centuries.  In 1858 a timber screen was inserted in place of a chancel arch.  The church was restored in 1877 by E Haycock (junior), the south porch was rebuilt at this time.</p>
<p>In the south aisle is a trefoil headed piscina.</p>
<p>The font probably dates from Norman times (it is carved with seven heads around the brim, together with a beast, a lighted candel and a cockerel); the font is thought to sit on a Roman column.</p>
<p>There is a oaken effigy of a man in a tomb recess in the south aisle, it depicts a knight (identity unknown) in 13th Century armour, his head is resting on cushions and his legs on a lion.  The effigy possibly dates from the 14th Century and is known as 'Old Scriven' - he is said to have fought a lion and received damage to the face thereby.</p>
<p>The organ was made in 1913 by Blackett and Howden.  There is a ring of eight bells, six were cast in 1796 by Thomas Mears I, and the other two in 1951 by Mears and Stainbank, all at the Whitechapel foundary.</p>
<p>At the west end of the nave, high up in the corners, are two sculptures of the late 12th and 13th Centuries.  These are demi-figures, the one at the south appears to have a devil on the left shoulder and be wielding a stick in the right hand; the other wears some sort of cape.  The significance is unknown, but it is thought that the south one represents the dammed and the other the blessed.</p>
<p>The pulpit is Victorian, 1861 to 1862.  The stained glass is by David Evans, from 1820, and depicts St John the Evangelist, St John the Baptist and St Peter.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means 'homestead (tun) by a fort (burh)', in the Doemsday Book it was called Beritune.</p>

<p>The church was build in around 1140 AD in the reign of King Stephen and was restored in 1875 by G E Street.  The original Norman doorway was blocked in the 14th Century, and a new door was built along with the timber framed porch (which is considered to be one of the finest medieval porches in the county).  There are also some glazed floor tiles fron circa 1500.</p>
<p>The pulpit is Jacobean and unusual in that it is a double pulpit.  The font is largely original Norman stonework.  The church has an Easter Sepulchre dating from around 1320 (the only church is Shropshire with this feature).</p>
<p>The bellcote houses two bells, the north bell dates from the fourteenth century.  The south bell is inscribed ‘God Save The Queen A. R. 1707’.</p>
<p>In the churchyard are two ancient (ones with a girth of over 20ft) yew trees, one male and one female.</p>
<p>Billingsley in Shropshire is the only village in the Country with that name.  Billingsley was an important mining and industrial centre from the time of the Napoleonic Wars until the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>The origin of the name of the settlement is uncertain, Billing may refer to the Old English for a hill (or ridge) or a personal name.  Leah is the Old English for a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.</p>

<p>Bishop's Castle is named from the castle built there by the Bishop of Hereford in circa 1127.</p>
<p>The original church was built towards the end of the 13th century to serve the medieval town controlled by the Bishops of Hereford.  Only the tower remains of the original church (but this was rebuilt in 1648 after the church was badly damaged in 1645 during the Civil War).  The rest of the church was completely re-built in 1869-60 by Thomas Nicholson in the Victorian Gothic style.</p>
<p>During the rebuild, an Early English (1180-1275) doorway was removed and is now in the wall of the vicarage garden.  Also from the old church are a plain Norman font and a demi-figure of an Elizabethan divine (now upright).  Some of the stained glass is Pre-Raphaelite, other windows are considered fine examples of Victorian glass and are by Powell's, O'Connor and Henry Holiday.</p>

<p>In 1086 AD Roger de Montgomery founded a collegiate church at Quatford which was transferred to Bridgnorth in 1101 AD.  A Castle was built and the first church of St Mary Magdalene was the chapel of the castle.  A later medieval church was built, but by the late 18th Century this church was in a state of disrepair.  Thomas Telford (who had correctly predicted the collapse of St Chad's) examined the church and advised that it be completely rebuilt.</p>
<p>Telford was commissioned to design the new church.</p>
<p>It is aligned north-south, rather than the more usual west-east.</p>
<p>The name of the town derives from the Old English brycg (a bridge or causeway) and noro (northern or north).</p>

<p>In Anglo-Saxon times Bromfield was an important collegiate church with 12 canons.  In circa 1060 Edward the Confessor issued a writ to the canons granting extensive liberties.  It was described as being a wealthy minster of royal foundation.</p>
<p>The church is mentioned in the Domesday book and Bromfield is described as a holding of St Mary's, Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>During the early 12th Century the canons were gradually replaced by monks and a Benedictine priory was established in 1155 AD (Henry II granted the charter); the priory was subject to the abbey in Gloucester.</p>
<p>The priory took over part of the existing parish church, which had been rebuilt in the 12th Century with a cruciform plan, possibly with a tower at the crossing.  At some point the tower and the north transept disappeared, possibly following the fall of the tower.  The present tower is 13th Century.</p>
<p>The priory was dissolved in 1540 AD and the buildings were taken over by Charles Foxe - he incorporated the present chancel (the former crossing) into his residence and it was divided into two stories.  The south transept was converted to form the rest of the house.  There are still parts of the Tudor residence in the grounds of the present church.</p>
<p>In the 17th Century the house was damaged by fire and the occupants moved away.  The church was restored for worship in 1658 AD.</p>
<p>The church was further restored in 1889-90 by Hodgson Fowler (a prolific ecclesiastical architect of the Victorian era) who also designed the triptych behind the altar.</p>
<p>The oldest feature in the church is the Norman chancel arch.</p>
<p>The chancel has a Baroque painted ceiling by Cheshire artist Thomas Francis (1672).  On the south wall of the nave is the Royal Coat of Arms of Charles II - one the largest in existence.  Most of the stained glass is by Kempe (a renowned designer and manufacturer of stained glass in the Victorian era).  The Saints featured in the west window are all female, which in unusual.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means 'broomy' open land (brom is the Old English for Broom (a thorny bush or shrub) and feld is the Old English open country or unencumbered ground.</p>

<p>This church is considered to be the finest early Victorian church in the county, and is constructed throughout in an authentic Perpendicular style.  It is built of stone from Grinshill.</p>
<p>In the late 16th and early 17th Centuries, the wooded parish of Broseley expanded as the coal-mining industry grew, there was further expansion in the 18th Century with increasing industry in the area.  This made the existing church unsuitable for the increasing population.</p>
<p>In the early 1700's, what was probably the original medieval church, was completely rebuilt and finished in 1716.  The present church then replaced this building.  When the new church was consecrated the dedication was changed from St Leonard to All Saints.</p>
<p>The church contains a window by Kempe.</p>
<p>A settlement existed at Broseley in 1086 and is listed as Bosle in the Domesday Book.  The name of the town likely derives from either the Old English for town's guardian (burh-weard) or the Old English personal name Burgweard, and the Old English leah meaning a forest, wood, glade or clearing (and later a pasture or meadow).</p>

<p>The Domesday Book records the presence of a church with two priests which is unusual.</p>
<p>The church comprises a mixture of medieval and Victorian elements; the chancel is 12th Century the nave and tower are later and date from the 14th Century.  In 1889-90 the church was extensively restored by Sir Aston Webb, an English architect who designed the principal facade of Buckingham Palace and the main building of the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>
<p>There is some good stained glass by Powell.  By the south door is a medieval water stoup.  The parish chest is medieval.  The rood screen is Victorian and was made in Louvain (Leuven, Belgium).  The are other good Victorian fittings - the pulpit, lectern, chandeliers and the chancel roof (all by Webb, an early believer in the arts and crafts style).  The reredos is mahogany.</p>
<p>There are a number of notable memorials dating from the 14th to the 19th Century.  The Cornwall family were lords of Burford for 400 years from the mid-14th Century (the castle was on the site of the present day Burford House).  The brass monument in the floor is c. 1370 to Dame Elizabeth Cornewayle.  The tomb recess (14th Century) contains an alabaster effigy of Princess Elizabeth, daughter of John of Gaunt, who died in 1426.  There is an unusual heart tomb commemorating Edmond Cornwall who died in 1436 - he directed that his heart should be enclosed in lead and buried in the church.  In the centre of the chancel is a rare oaken effigy to another Edmond Cornwall who died in 1508.  The monuments high on the chancel wall are dated 1630.</p>
<p>The triptych on the north wall (not open when we visited), is a huge Elizabethan piece, painted by Melchior Salabuss and dated 1588 (the year of the Armada).</p>
<p>The name of the settlement derives from the Old English for a fortified place (burh) by a ford.</p>

<p>The church is known to have existed prior to 1276, as there is one window in the chancel in the present building from before that date.  By the 18th Century, the medieval church was in a poor state of repair and it was replaced by a new building in 1749, the building was significantly remodelled in 1844.  The church needed further restoration in 1905.</p>
<p>The church is notable for its unusual tower (which was added in 1844) as the square lower stage becomes octagonal above angle broaches.  The architect of the tower, vestry and new windows in the nave was Thomas Jones of Chester who had been employed by the Leightons at Loton Park and in Alberbury church.  Three designs were were proposed, a square tower, a spire and a square base with an octagonal tower.  In medieval times, an octagon was considered to be halfway between a circle (God) and a square (the Earth).  It was the place where heaven and earth came into contact.  This is why pulpits and fonts are often octagonal in shape.</p>
<p>To fund the building of a tower, 500 pounds was donated by Lady Leighton from the proceeds of her published engraved picture of The Ladies of Llangollen.  The engraved picture was based on a sketch by Mary Parker a friend of The Ladies of Llangollen who often visited and secretly drew their portraits as they were unwilling to have their portraits taken formally.</p>
<p>The village name means Card's farm/settlement (Card being a personal name).</p>

<p>The presence of a church on the site is recorded in the Domesday Book.  In 1167, the village, including the church, was given to the Knights Templar (and was known as Templars' Cardington, allowing the people to share the privileges of the Knights).  It remained in their possession until 1308 (when the order was supressed).  The Knights were responsible for starting the building of the present church in the later part of the 12th Century.  During the following century the chancel was rebuilt and extended, and the tower was added.  Further additions and alterations were made during the following three centuries, followed by the porch in 1639.</p>
<p>The body of the church is constructed in sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings and has tiled roofs.  The south doorway contains a door dated 1648.</p>
<p>In the churchyard is a sandstone sundial dating from the middle of the 18th Century.</p>
<p>In the Domesday Book the village is referred to as 'Cardintine under the Fief of Rainwald Vicecomes' and it is mentioned that there were 11 leagues of woodland.  The name 'Cardington' derives from an English chief and warrior named Carda, whose sons and followers were called the Cardinga.  They made their home where the village is, and the village they built became known as Cardington, or the town of the sons of Carda.</p>
<p>In the church is a large monument to Chief Justice of Leighton of Plaish (died 1607), this Jacobean monument is the earliest in Shropshire which depicts the deceased lying on his side.</p>
<p>Judge Leighton was known as 'the hanging judge' (as was Judge Jeffries) as he condemned so many people to be hanged.  Amongst those condemned by Leighton was a local builder, who had come to the judge to ask to be pardoned for his crime.  The Judge promised him that if he would build him the finest set of chimneys he had ever yet built he would spare his life.  The builder did construct the chimneys (on Plaish Hall).  But after completing the job the Judge ordered the mans' eyes to be put out, and for him to be hanged from the same chimneys he had just built (so that he could build no more chimneys ever finer).  It is said that one can see the rope with which the builder was hanged.</p>

<p>Although there is evidence of a Norman church existing on the site, the present church dates from the 14th Century (probably completed by 1345).  The lower part of the tower is from this time too, the upper part of the brick tower dates from the early 18th Century (cira 1720).  The south porch was built in 1887 by J Farmer of Newport.</p>
<p>The stained glass in the east window is dated 1892, it was designed by Kempe, and depicts the Crucifixion.  In the south window of the chancel is glass by Burlison and Grylls, dating from about 1888, and depicting the Parable of the Sower.</p>
<p>The pulpit is partly Jacobean and the font is Norman.</p>
<p>The carvings on the oak structures in the Chancel and Sanctuary completed between 1887 - 1899 by local boys taught by the vicar.</p>
<p>There is a ring of six bells, all of which were cast in 1720 by Abraham Rudhall II of Gloucester.</p>
<p>The place name is thought to derive from the Old English Cegel, meaning pole, as it is believed that the marsh may have been marked out by posts.</p>

<p>An Anglo-Saxon church was founded circa 915 when a fort was built on the site.  The current building dates from the 12th Century.  The aisles and arcades were added in the 13th Century - the arcades noticeably lean outwards.  The tower was constructed around 1300 and the chancel was added in 1733.  The church was restored in 1871-72.  The tower and body of the church were constructed using limestone rubble with pink sandstone ashlar dressings and slate roofs.  The chancel is red brick with a tiled roof.</p>
<p>In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle the place name was recorded as Cyricbyrig.  Later in 1086 in the Domesday book, the place name was recorded as Cireberie which means 'a fortified place with a church'.</p>
<p>The church was reformed into the church of the Augustinian Priory at Chirbury when the order relocated from Snead (near Bishop's Castle) round about 1220.  With the dissolution of the Priory in 1535, the church became a parish church once again.  The church as seen today is the nave of the Priory.</p>

<p>The church was built in the 13th Century and is 70 feet long by 13foot wide. It was originally a monastic church, which explains the appearance. The church was founded as a cell of Wenlock Priory in 1163 when the manor was granted to the priory.  The monastic cell survived as a priory until 1534.  The church was probably built circa 1200 AD.</p>
<p>The west wall collapsed during restoration in 1866, the bell-turret and roof date from this time.</p>
<p>The pulpit is Jacobean.</p>
<p>Although the priory buildimgs survived until the 18th Century, they were demolished and replaced by the present Preen Manor in 1870.</p>
<p>In the churchyard is one of the oldest and largest yew trees in the country.</p>
<p>The name of the village is thought to be derived from the Old English 'preon' meaning pin or brooch which describes the shape of the nearest hill.</p>

<p>The medieval church (the church's first known priest was 'John the Chaplain', recorded before 1193) was destroyed by the Welsh some time around 1400, the successor building was constructed in the Georgian style in 1773.  However, the nave, chancel and north aisle were restored in the 1850s.</p>
<p>The churchyard contains a number of tombs of interest, including an urn shaped tomb dating from the 18th Century.  The churchyard is circular and was thought to have been a defensive site, there are a number of mature yew trees in the churchyard.</p>

<p>The Domesday book makes reference to a church in the Manor existing before the Norman conquest, most likely a small wooden building.</p>
<p>The name Stretton is derived from the old name Stratun which means 'tun' (settlement) near to the 'Street' or Roman Road.</p>
<p>The Norman church was probably built around 1110 to 1130 as the region was growing in prosperity and population (and the Welsh boarder was quieter).</p>
<p>The church was extended in circa 1214 AD - a new chancel, transcepts in the form of a cruciform and the lower tower were constructed.  A century or so later, the windows were enlarged and the tower was extended.</p>

<p>The church can trace its origins back to the 7th Century (Saxon), however, the present church dates from the 12th Century.</p>
<p>Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, held the manor and the church was connected with the collegiate foundation which he endowed at Quatford.</p>
<p>The church was added to in the 13th and 15th Centuries - the tower was doubled in height and angle buttresses were added to it towards the end of the 15th century.  At about the same time the north chapel was added.</p>
<p>The church is noted for the medieval wall paintings which have been dated to circa 1200, and includes a frieze of fighting knights, under which is painting depicting the martyrdom of Saint Margaret of Antioch.</p>
<p>The northwest buttress of the tower, which was added in the 15th century, projects inside the church forming a round-headed niche, known as the 'seat of penitence'.</p>
<p>The font is Norman, shaped like a tub, and carved with arcades.  The pulpit is Jacobean, and is carved with rosettes under arcading.</p>
<p>The stained glass in the east window dates from 1858, is by Frederick Preedy, and depicts the Te Deum.</p>
<p>The tomb-chest is a monument to Sir Robert Broke, who died in 1558, and his two wives is in alabaster with three recumbent effigies, and children standing around the sides.</p>
<p>The two-manual pipe organ was made in 1906 by J. W. Walker, and rebuilt in 1964 by W. Hawkins.  There is a ring of eight bells, the oldest are two bells cast in 1703 by Abraham Rudhall I, followed by a single bell by Thomas Rudhall in 1769. Another single bell is dated 1877 and is by John Taylor and Company. The last four bells were cast in 1929 by Gillett and Johnston.</p>
<p>The name Claverley means 'clover meadow'.</p>

<p>Cleobury passed to the Mortimer family (one of the great Marcher families) after the Norman conquest.  The name Cleobury derives from the Old English for ball (cleo) which describes the shape of the hill and burh (a fortified place).</p>
<p>It is likley that there was a Saxon church on the site as the presence of a priest is recorded in the Domesday Book.  The present church is largely Early English - the earliest part is the tower, which dates from the 12th Century.  The spire was added during the following Century.  The nave and chancel were built in the 13th Century, with the aisles, chantry chapel and porch being added later in that Century.  The nave and chancel roofs date from the 14th Century, and the north vestry from the following Century.  The arcades lean outwards and were first stabilised by Thomas Telford in the 1790s, buttresses were added later.  The church was restored in 1874-75 by George Gilbert Scott.</p>
<p>Te spire was re-shingled in 1994.  The shingled spire is not quite symmetrical when seen from certain viewpoints.</p>
<p>The east window contains stained glass dated 1875, designed by Harry Burrow, and made by Powell's, depicting The Vision of Piers Plowman.</p>
<p>The organ was made in 1884 by Nicholson, it was rebuilt in 1904, and further improved in the 1970s.  There is a ring of six bells - five of these were cast in 1757 by Adam Rudhall, and the other in 1925 by Gillett and Johnston.</p>

<p>There was an earlier wooden church on the site (also dedicated to the Anglo Saxon St Cuthbert).  The present building was started round about 1305 by the then Lord of the Manor, Roger de Halberdine, just before a mini ice age.  The villagers continued building the church for more than 40 years.  It is known (by dendrochronological dating) that the roof beams are of local oak felled in 1329-39 and put up straight away.</p>
<p>The Earl of Arundel probably helped with the costs as Roger de Halberdine had been bankrupted by the church build costs.</p>
<p>The side chapel was reroofed in 1415 after a fire, and the Victorians added a stone tower to house the bells.</p>
<p>Earlier glass and decations were destroyed in the Reformation, but the tomb recess (for Roger de Halberdine) and the 14th Centurt parish chest remain.</p>
<p>The organ is considered to a fine work of Binns (one of the most successful and prolific of the numerous Yorkshire organ builders working at the turn of the 20th century).</p>
<p>The name of the settlement derives from the name of the river (Clun, origin of name unknown), a ford and a personal name.</p>

<p>With the support of the Darbys a new church was planned for the village of Coalbrookdale.  The foundation stone was laid by Abraham's wife, Matilda Frances, on 11th December 1851 and the completed building was consecrated by the Bishop of Hereford on 25th July 1854.</p>
<p>The church is notable because unusually a number of the gravemarkers were locally cast in iron.</p>
<p>The most notable grave is that of Abraham Darby IV and his Wife Matilda.</p>
<p>Other memorial plaques of note are the one for Captain Matthew Webb and Thomas Parker (a famous electrical engineer and inventor).</p>
<p>The window depicting the last supper is a rare 16th Century Flemish window - note that Judas Iscariot is portrayed with five fingers and a thumb, seen as a mark of the devil at the time.</p>

<p>In Anglo-Saxon times, Condover was a minster church served by a college of priests and so was the centre of an extensive parish - there were a number of dependent chapelries in nearby settlements.  Before the Norman invasion the manor was held by Edward the Confessor.  The Domesday book mentions the presence of a priest, but all trace of the original building has been lost.</p>
<p>It is thought that masonry from buildings at the Roman City at Wroxeter has been incorporated into the fabric of the church.</p>
<p>The medieval church was substantially destroyed in 1660 when the tower collapsed.  The Norman north transcept and the Early English chancel were all that were left intact.  The church was rebuilt in 1662-64.  The chancel was then rebuilt again in 1867-68 by Reginald Cholmondeley, who was lord of the manor.  The hammer beam roof also dates from the 17th Century.</p>
<p>The church is one largest country churches in Shropshire.  The church contains a notable collection of monuments.</p>
<p>The churchyard contains one of the finest collections of church monuments in Shropshire, the earliest from the 16th century.  Most of these monuments and family tombs date from the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
<p>The name of the village means bank or ridge by the River Cound, the suffix 'ofer' is the Old English word meaning the tip of a promontory or a flat-topped ridge.</p>
<p>In the Domesday book the name of the village is recorded as Conendovre.</p>

<p>The church is dedicated to St Peter because of its medieval association with Shrewsbury Abbey, which is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul.</p>
<p>The oldest part of the church is the nave which dates from the 13th Century, and although the south aisle was built at the same time as the nave it was rebuilt a century later.  Since then the church has been added to quite considerably.  The tower was added in the 15th Century and in 1841/1842 the north aisle was built.  In 1862 the chancel was built and in 1889-91 the vestry was added re-using the 13th-century priest's door.</p>
<p>The church is constructed in red and yellow sandstone.  In the older parts of the building the colours are used randomly, and for the 19th Century additions the blocks are deliberately arranged.</p>
<p>The interior has many features of interest including the font which dates from the 12th Century (Norman) and the Pulpit which is dates 1633 (Jacobean).  In the chancel are re-used medieval tiles.  Over the chancel arch is part of a 15th Century wall painting of the Last Judgement.  There are many monuments on the interior walls.  In the churchyard is a sandstone cross base dating from the 18th Century or earlier.</p>
<p>The name of the village is taken from the nearby brook, Cound Brook.  In the Domesday book, the manor was recorded as Cuneet.</p>

<p>The name Cressage means 'Christ's Oak', and so it is thought the village's location may be a very early Christian site (possibly an oak tree from where the gospel was preached).</p>
<p>There was a medieval church at Cressage, but it suffered repeated flooding from the nearby river Severn and so the current church was built on higher ground.  The rather austere church was architected by Edward Haycock snr (Haycock was responsible for 14 churches in Shropshire, other work by him includes Millichope Park and the Lord Hill monument in Shrewsbury).</p>
<p>The octagonal pulpit is made of panelling from St Samson's church (the old medieval church).</p>

<p>The tower is 13th Century, the lower part of the spire was added about a century later, but was never completed.  The present top was added in the 1960s, put in place with a helicopter, and replaced a lead cap which had become porous.</p>
<p>The windows are mainly 14th Century, although two small windows in the nave are 11th Century and the east window is of about 1865 (when there was a major restoration).</p>
<p>The unusual roof structure is probably late medieval (1500 AD).  The rood screen dates from the 15th Century and has survived the Reformation in 1534 and later restorations.</p>
<p>There are two fonts, one Victorian, the other Norman (circa 1150 AD) which came from Burwarton church when it closed.  There are also two piscinas, one is a particularly fine example of a double piscina.</p>
<p>There are remains of wall-paintings from the 16th or 17th Century which depict the 10 commandments.  The stained glass in the aisle is considered to be particularly good, it depicts St Michael and a Christian soldier (made in 1901 and given in memory of a Captain killed in the Boer War).</p>
<p>Many of the monuments are to the family who were Lords of the Manor of Culmington.  The three bells were recast by Thomas Clibury of Wellington, one in 1629 and the other two in 1663.</p>
<p>The origin of name of the settlement is uncertain, but most likely derives from Culm (Old English for winding river as the river Corve is close and may have been called Culm (from the Welsh)) and the Old English 'ingtun' meaning 'a farm / settlement called after or connected with', so is the settlement of dwellers on the Culm.</p>

<p>Projecting from the pulpit is a wrought iron hourglass holder, the hourglass was used to restrict the ‘extraordinary length of services’ in 1662.  Hourglasses were introduced in the 17th Century in many churches to measure the duration of the parson’s sermon, but few survive.</p>

<h3>Eaton-under-Heywood - St Edith</h3>
<p><b>Grade: I</b></p>

<img class="imgr" src="assets/images/churches/2022-04-23_15_12_49_DSC_1218.jpg" alt="" align="left">
<p>St Edith is said to be the daughter of King Egbert of Wessex (reigned 802 to 839).  The Domesday Book does not mention this settlement, but does include the nearby Ticklerton.  But with the expansion of the Wenlock Priory estates, Eaton was a more central and suitable location for a parish church to serve the surrounding hamlets.</p>
<p>The nave and chancel are Norman and the chancel is Early English.  The upper part of the tower has Perpendicular battlements.  The nave roof dates from the 15th Century, and the chancel roof from about 1600.  The central aisle has a distinct slope to it.</p>
<p>Between the roofs of the chancel and nave is a tympanum painted in the 1860s with the arms of local landowners.  Along the feet of the rafters are a series of carved faces.  The pulpit is dated 1670 and is a good example with a sounding board, although the lower part may date from the 16th Century.  The font is probably Norman and the unique chain hung cover dates from 1872.</p>
<p>In the Early English chancel are three widely spaced plain lancet windows of equal height depicting subjects relating to St Edith - an unusual arrangement - the windows were restored in 1869 and so it is unknown if this was the original design.</p>
<p>In the north wall of the chancel is a 14th Century recess which contains an oaken effigy of a civilian.</p>
<p>In the chancel is a carved green man.</p>
<p>There is a ring of three bells, the two oldest were cast in 1615 and 1622 by William Clibury, and the third by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1869.</p>
<p>The name of the place derives from the Old English 'ea' meaning a river and tun meaning an enclosure, farmstead, village or estate (despite the place being on a small tributary of the river Onny).  Heywood was a royal forest mentioned in 1250, again from the Old English 'haeg' meaning a fence or enclosure and 'wudu' meaning a wood, or wood / timber.</p>

<p>At the time of the Domesday survey, the manor at Ford was one of the most prosperous in the county.  The church occupies the highest site in the village.</p>
<p>The nave and chancel originally date from circa 1200, but very little of the medieval building remains.  Most of the present building dates from 1875 when the church was restored.</p>
<p>The church is most noted for the 15th Century roof of the nave, which consists of alternate hammer beams and collar beams with arched braces; at the sides are three tiers of cusped wind-braces.</p>
<p>The screen is late Perpendicular and the reredos is Jacobean woodwork with five panels of human figures said to be of 16th Century Flemish workmanship.</p>
<p>The name of the village derives from the fact that there are one or more fords across the river Severn in near proximity to the settlement (just to the north).</p>

A medieval church was recorded in 1790, but there is no trace of either of the prior churches remaining.  Blomfield also designed the font.</p>
<p>The east window is from 1888 by Kempe and depicts the Adoration of the Shepherds.  There is an old Norman tub font from the previous church.</p>
<p>The origin of the name of the settlement is uncertain, Glaes may refer to the Old English for glass or bright / clear perhaps describing a lost stream.  Leah is the Old English for a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.</p>

<p>The present church was built in 1788. It replaced a former chapel dating from 1300 AD and was constructed using rubble from the old chapel. From 1864 to 1871 this was the parish church of Great Wollaston.

<p>The church was considerably restored in 1855.</p>

<p>The church was restored and partly re-built circa 1864 in the early English style.  It was formerly a chapelry of Worthen, and probably became an independent parish during the 12th Century (it is not mentioned in the Domesday Book).</p>
<p>There are no original windows remaining, but the three-light square headed window dates from the 16th Century.</p>
<p>The font probably dates from the 12th or 13th Century and was recut in 1766.</p>
<p>The crude buttress of the chancel was probably built in 1678 when it was noted 'the end of the church is said to be in decay'.</p>
<p>The name of the settlemt means 'Heathuburh's/Heahburh's wood/clearing', a feminine personal name.</p>

<p>The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as it had been bestowed to the Norman Lord Helgot.</p>
<p>Little is known of the origins of the church, but the tower is the oldest part, and it is considered to be from the 14th century.  The main body of the church was demolished in 1845 and was rebuilt by 1846 at a cost of £550.  The architect was S. Pountney Smith of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The church has maintained its Victorian Box Pews.</p>
<p>The font is late Norman and because it is so plain in design and structure, it was replaced by a Victorian-designed font around the time of rebuilding the church.  In the early 20th Century, the Norman font was brought back into the church, and the Victorian-designed font was placed outside.</p>
<p>The original Church Clock was made in 1701 and that was replaced in 1814 to the present clock.</p>
<p>Harley is the only village in Shropshire that is entitled to be called a ‘Thankful Village’ because after the First World War, all twenty of the men who had gone to serve in the war returned safely.  Consequently there is not a war memorial in the village, but there are two memorials, one in the village hall and the other in the church both recording the names of the men who served.</p>
<p>The name of settlement probably means, 'rock wood/clearing'.  Haer is the Old English for a rock, a heap of stones, a tumulus, and leah is the Old English for a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.</p>

<p>Heath is an ancient chapelry of the parish of Stoke St Milborough, and the chapel is the only remianing structure of the medieval village.</p>
<p>The chapel is a rarity in that it has been virtually unaltered for 850 years - the only change in that time being the enlargement of the window in the north wall approx. 300 years ago.</p>
<p>The door retains some 12th Century wrought iron-work.  The font is Norman.  The pulpit and box pews date from the 17th Century.</p>
<p>The medieval wall paintings are awaiting conservation, they were discovered in 1911.  The identified subjects of the wall paintings include Saint George on the south wall, and the Last Judgement above the chancel arch. The 17th-century texts are present but faded.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement is from the Old English for Heather; a tract of uncultivated land.</p>

<p>At the time of the Domesday book, Stantune was one of a small number of manors in Shropshire with both a church and priest, suggesting there was a Saxon church here.  The parish is now one of the smallest in the diocese.</p>
<p>The nave and possibly part of the chancel date from the 12th century, with the rest of the chancel and the lower part of the tower from the following century.  The south porch was probably added in the 14th Century and is notable for its carving.  The upper part of the tower dates from the 15th or 17th Century.  The church was restored in 1854 to 1855 and again in 1894 to 1895.</p>
<p>The pews are box pews, one of which has a desk dated 1707 attached to its back.  Also in the church is a pair of Jacobean seats with carved canopies.  The circular Norman font is elaborately carved with rope moulding, a dragon, interlace, foliage, and medallions.  In the church are royal arms of 1757.  In the south wall of the nave is a tomb recess dating from the 14th century.</p>
<p>During the Middle Ages, the parish was served by three portionists (priest, deacon and sub-deacon)who formed a secular college, this arrangement survived the Reformation.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement is Helgot's castle', but the 'castle' has been lost.  Helgot was the name of the tenant in 1086.  In the Domesday Book, the place is called Stantune, from The Old English stan and tun, 'stone farm/settlement'.</p>

<p>The church was rebuilt in circa 1360, with only the north wall of the 13th Century nave retained from the previous building.</p>
<p>The bell tower dates from 1701 and the porch is sometime before that.  The church was restored in 1871-2.</p>
<p>The church has what is considered to be the finest rood screen in Shropshire, which dates from the end of the 15th Century.  It is believed to have been moved to the church from Buildwas Abbey following the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII.  It is thought to have been made in Ludlow.</p>
<p>There are traces of medieval stained glass in the north and east chancel windows (late 14th Century).</p>
<p>The oak parish chest is likely medieval.</p>
<p>To the right of the altar is a corbel, which has the form of a lady's head. In the south wall is a pillar piscina, something which is not normally seen in Anglican churches. In the floor of the chancel are medieval tiles.  The roof is of note, put in the 1870s the roof is a boarded trussed-rafter roof with bosses.</p>
<p>The pulpit is Jacobean.</p>
<p>The church is mentioned in Housman's A Shropshire Lad.</p>
<p>The original building was an ancient chapelry of Much Wenlock, and was founded before 1176. It was rebuilt during the 13th and 14th centuries out of limestone rubble and sandstone ashlar dressing, becoming a parish church in its own right during the 16th century.</p>
<p>Hughley is not mentioned in the Domesday book, but the settlement was held by Wenlock Priory in the hundred of Condover. This original manor was known as Legh or Leye, the name Hugh comes from Sir Hugh de Lega (likely a knight who received land grants) who was first mentioned in circa 1170.</p>

<p>The area was originally part of the parish of Madeley, but with the growth of the population due to the bridge, it was thought necessary for Ironbridge to have its own church.  The church was designed by Thomas Smith of Madeley and the lowest offer to build was accepted (that of Samuel Smith and Son of Madeley Wood) - the final cost of the building was 2,942 pounds 16 shillings 1 pence.  It is understood that 321,000 bricks were used (then priced at 8s 0d per thousand).</p>
<p>The position of Ironbridge church is the reverse of the majority of churches, the sanctuary is at the west end and the tower at the east end.  This is because the land at the west end would not bear the weight of a tower.</p>
<p>The church was completed by the middle of 1837, but owing to the death of the then Bishop of Hereford, it was not consecrated until 26th October 1837, although permission was given to hold services prior to consecration.</p>

<p>The present church was build in 1863 to replace a chapel (dating from 1759).  The church was designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield and is considered to be the best of the four Shropshire churches he designed.  Blomfield was a prolific architect, and a leading figure in his profession.</p>
<p>The church has an unusual bell-turret, the style is French Gothic which was in vogue in the 1860s.  The church is most noted for its tiles - there are both Maws and Craven Dunhill tiles in the building.</p>
<p>The sanctuary windows are claimed to be of the school of the Pre-Raphaelites.  The triptych behind the altar was originally produced in about 1870 for an exhibition in Paris, it is a demonstration of the skills at Craven Dunhill in making hand-painted tiles.</p>
<p>The stone font was presented to the church by the godchildren of George Pritchard (the church was constructed in memory of Pritchard, who died in 1861 - he was a banker, benefactor and High Sheriff of Shropshire).</p>

<p>The date of this church is uncertain, but the nave and chancel probably date from the 12th Century - evidenced by the round headed doorway in the north wall of the nave.</p>
<p>This church has an unusual low tower whose pyramid roof starts below the ridge of the nave roof.</p>
<p>The church was restored in 1854 and again in 2016.</p>
<p>The chancel roof is considered to be an excellent example of a roof with collar-beams on arched braces, with wind-braces laterally.  The roof is thought to be 14th Century.</p>
<p>The best feature in the church is the pulpit, a Jacobean structure complete with its tester.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means in Old English 'Cena's wood/clearing' - Cena is a personal name, and leah is a forest, wood, glade or clearing (and later a pasture or meadow).</p>

<p>In 1313 the lords of the manor at Langley (the Burnell's of Actor Burnell) obtained permission to build a chapel at Langley.  The structure of the present building dates from this time.  The chapel was fitted out in about 1546 by the Lee family (to whom the manor of Langley had passed in the second half of the 14th Century).  The chapel was re-roofed in 1601 by the same family.</p>
<p>By the start of the 18th Century, the chapel had largely fallen out of use, and so avoided the changes being made to churches to re-order interiors to the more elaborate 'high church' model favoured in the 19th Century.  Consequently, it is the set of early 17th Century fittings that makes this chapel significant.</p>
<p>The last regular service was held at Langley Chapel in 1871.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement derives from the Old English meaning long wood/clearing - lang (long or tall) and leah (a forest, wood, glade or clearing, and later a pasture or meadow).</p>

<p>Originally a hermitage owned by Haughmond Abbey the stone church was built in circa 1200 AD.  The church was altered in 1829 with the addition of the tower.  A church on the site is first recorded in 1183.  The church is notable for the completeness of its 18th Century and early 19th Centiury fittings and monuments.</p>
<p>The church is built on glacial moraine, which provided a secure foundation.</p>
<p>A medieval wall painting of the Nativity was discovered in 1976 and the Welsh dragon carvings on the Western roof truss are of particular note.  The wall painting depicts large late medieval figures which are fragmentary and are of Mary and Christ receiving gifts from what are either angels or Kings.</p>
<p>The panelled box pews date from 1776.</p>
<p>There are many monuments, especially notable is the large tablet monument to Sir Uvedale Corbett (d.1701) with gadrooned base, flanking columns, and swan-necked pediment with 2 reclining figures.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means 'Botta's wood' with the later addition of 'clearing'.  From the Old English 'wudu' meaning a wood; or wood, timber, and, 'leah' meaning a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.</p>

<p>The church is a near-complete twelfth-century church.  It is built entirely from local rubble stone except for the dressing stones and a tiled roof and was built as a chapel of ease for Much Wenlock.</p>
<p>The north doorway is blocked but its weathered tympanum features a mysterious green man.</p>
<p>The interior contains more Romanesque carving as illustrated by the round tub font.  The decoration consists of carved cable-moulding around the rim, and medallions which, on the north side, emerge from the mouths of demonic masks.</p>
<p>The altar triptych of a cross and angels painted on board is by Harry Burrows circa 1870.</p>
<p>Some restoration in the nineteenth century led to tiled floors throughout, with encaustic tiles in the sanctuary by Maw &amp; Co. In 1858 Sir Arthur Blomfield paid for the enlargement of the nave windows, the rebuilding of the east wall with a new window, the installation of new benches, and pews and choir stalls with shaped ends and open backs. The chancel has a panelled dado made in 1858 from former pews.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means 'Lime-tree wood/clearing' from the Old English 'lind' (a lime-tree) and leah a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.</p>

<p>The church was built in 1903 from a mass produced Manchester flat-pack and given a mock Tudor style exterior and thatched roof.</p>
<p>It’s constructed of timber and was painted black and white to blend in with the adjacent old timber framed manor house. It originally had a corrugated iron roof, but because it was noisy when it rained and the congregation couldn’t hear the pastor, it was replaced with the thatch.</p>

<p>The oldest surving part of the church is the Lady Chapel, which dates from the 12th Century (and the list of incumbents goes back to 1260).  The original nave, which is now the north aisle, is medieval (thought to be 15th Century as the arch-braced roof is typical of this period).  The tower was added in 1667.  The brick nave was added in 1822 and the chancel in 1875.</p>
<p>In the tower there are five bells, dating from 1704.</p>
<p>The church contains one of the earliest known cast iron grave slabs in Shropshire - dated 1611, it is set into the floor of the original chancel.  The church is also noted for the 19th Century stained glass commemorating members of the Forester and Edmonds families.</p>
<p>The communion table is 17th Century.  There is an oak chest from 1733 and the silver communion is dated 1742.</p>
<p>In 1849 Abraham Darby IV of Coalbrookdale joined the Church of England, having been raised as a Quaker, he was baptised at this church.</p>
<p>The name Wenlock is thought to be 'white enclosed place'.  The white probably refers to the limestone escarpment of Wenlock Edge.  'Winn' is primitive Welsh for white, and 'loca' is Old English for an enclosure.  'Little' derives from the Latin 'parva' for small.</p>

<p>The settlement of Ludford is older than Ludlow, and is mentioned in the Domesday Book.</p>
<p>The nave of the church is late Norman, the chancel 14th Century and there is a 16th Century family chapel with memorials to the Foxe and Charlton families.  In the chapel is an excellent brass to William Foxe (MP for Ludlow in 1523, 1529 and 1536) who died in 1554, also a recumbent effigy of Sir Job Charlton who died in 1697 (also MP for Ludlow and a distinguished judge).  The stained glass is Victorian.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, Ludford was a chapelry of the Benedictine priory at Bromfield</p>
<p>The place name means the ford at the loud waters ('lud').</p>

<p>One of the greatest parish churches in England.</p>
<p>Nothing remains of the original 11th Century church, but 100 years later a second church was built in a style of mixed Norman and early-English.  It is thought that a barrow was removed in 1199 to enlarge the churchyard.</p>
<p>There was a massive rebuilding of the church between 1433 and 1471, much of which was paid for by the wealthy Palmers' Guild, which endowed a number of chantries in the church.</p>

<h3>Lydbury North - St Michael and All Angels</h3>
<p><b>Grade: I</b></p>

<p>The manor of Lydbury North was held by Egwin Shakehead during the reign of Offa, but passed to the bishops of Hereford who held it at the time of the Domesday survey, an important church as it is mentioned in the Domesday book.  The earliest part of the church is Norman.</p>
<p>The tower is early 13th Century, it is a wide tower (circa 30ft) with a conspicuous lean to the west where it is supported by a number of heavy buttresses (themselves dating from 1624).</p>
<p>The north transept, the Plowden chapel, dates from the 14th Century.  In here are the stairs to the former rood loft.  The rood screen is late Perpendicular.  The south transept is the Walcot chapel, built in the mid-17th Century, probably after the restoration of Charkes II (1660).  This was a rare date for church building, the chapel has an upper floor which was previoulsy used as a schoolroom.</p>
<p>Between the nave and the chancel, the Perpendicular (but much restored) rood screen is surrounded by a fantastic and very rare tympanum.  This is inscribed with the Creed, the Ten Commandments and the Lord's Parayer and is dated 1615.</p>
<p>The church was restored in 1901-2 by J.T. Micklethwaite, who almost rebuilt the south transept from scratch, inserted a couple of additional nave windows and the new chancel east window, and did many less obvious things.</p>
<p>The box pews are essentially Jacobean, albeit restored and added to, and the church guide ascribes some of them to a date before 1617 (without explaining why) and most of the rest to the reign of Charles I (1625-49).  They are elaborately carved on the backs, doors and side panels, and all different from one another, yet all in general accord with the style of the pulpit, which Pevsner claimed is dated 1624.</p>
<p>The low font is Norman.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means 'Fortification on the Hlyde (= noisy stream)', perhaps an early name for the River Kemp.</p>

<p>The present church was designed by Thomas Telford and was consecrated on Easter Monday 1797.  There has been a church on the site since Norman times and it was appointed to Wenlock Priory in 1330, the original church had become unsafe and it was demolished in 1794.  The present building has an unusual design - it is an octagonal building on classical lines, but without the portico, columns, pilasters and large windows as seen at Bridgnorth.</p>
<p>The original church was dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, the name of the church was changed after the Reformation to 'St Michael's' suggesting Henry VIII's displeasure with the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The chancel was added in 1910.  On the north-east and south-east exterior faces are monuments to the Brooks family (who lived at Madeley Court in the 16th and 17th Centuries. The churchyard is extensive and includes 16 cast-iron tombs (arguably the best collection in the country.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement in Old English is Mad(d)a's (a personal name) wood/clearing.  Leah is Old English for a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.</p>

<p>The church is mentioned in the Domesday Book, but it does have a vague early history, partly due to it being the ancient Chapelry within the ecclesiastical parish of Neen Sollars.</p>
<p>The nave and chancel are 12th Century and Norman in origin.  The tower is early English 13th Century and the porch is 14th Century.  Two of the bells are registered as historically significant and a yew tree in the grounds is considered to be of national importance.</p>
<p>Pevsner noted that the most curious feature of the interior is a large lintel high up replacing a chancel arch and that the pulpit is Elizabethan with square ornamented panels in two tiers.  Although he describes the pulpit as Elizabethan, it is believed that it was made in 1899 by Mrs Gorton, the wife of the Rector, Mr A.H. Gorton, R.A. who dedicated it on April 28th, 1899.  She is said to have taught wood carving to the local people and the carving of the pulpit is a copy of a popular Elizabethan design.</p>
<p>The chancel east window is nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The font is believed to be Norman and is octagonal with rounded sides.  The screen at the vestry is one that was originally in Neen Sollars church and was adapted to fit at Milson.</p>
<p>There are four bells in the tower.  One is thought to be 14th Century and is unmarked.  The second one is dated 1698 and made by Abraham Rudhall.  The third is also unmarked but thought to be 17th Century and the fourth is dated 1723 also by Abraham Rudhall.</p>
<p>The Yew tree situated near the south door is of particular interest. It is one of the large and ancient Yews listed in Andrew Morton’s “The trees of Shropshire ” and is one of a group of National Importance.  The tree is estimated to be well in excess of 1000 years of age.</p>
<p>The origin of the name of the settlement is uncertain, is is either, 'mill-stone' or 'Mula's stone'.  It has been suggested that this name may have originally been 'Mula's farm/settlement' and early reinterpreted as 'mill-stone'.</p>

<p>The place name implies that there was minster church on the site in Saxon times (as it is recorded in the Domesday Book as Menistrelie), but nothing of any previous building exists.  Throughout the Middle Ages, Minsterley was a chapel of ease to Westbury, and remained so until 1689.  The present church was built between 1688 and 1689, it was funded by the 1st Viscount Weymouth, Thomas Thynne, as the family needed a new church when they acquired the nearby Minsterley Hall.  The Thynne family were local landowners and would become Marqusses of Bath.  The church was consecrated on Trinity Sunday 1692, the delay was probably due to a vacancy in see.  Herbert Croft of Croft Castle near Ludlow had been Dean of Hereford from 1644 to 1661 and Bishop from 1662 to 1691.  It is likely that the journey to Minsterley was too much to undertake at his age and the consecration was delayed until after the enthronement in 1691 of Bishop Gilbert Ironside.</p>
<p>The Architect was William Taylor, a Londoner who was also employed at Longleat.  The craftsmen were local, the foremason and bricklayer being Thomas Hudson of Shrewsbury, and the carpenter being Joseph Moateham.</p>
<p>The late 17th Century was not a period of great church-building outside of London (and even there the Churches replaced those consumed by the Great Fire of 1666).  Minsterley's Church is thus a rarity, and doubly so by virtue of a rustic classical-baroque stylistic mixture - the first church is Shropshire built on classical lines.  Minsterley was also the first church in Shropshire to be built in brick.  The dressings are Grinshill stone.</p>
<p>The church is notable for the carving on the west end of the exterior.</p>
<p>The church has a collection of seven maiden's garlands, these were placed over the grave of a 'bride to be' who died before her marriage. They were placed in the church in the 18th Century (1736 to 1794), and were made for the funerals of young girls to be placed on their coffins.</p>
<p>The organ dates from 1884.  The pulpit is old (date unknown), and was transferred from Westbury church.</p>
<p>The interior was altered in 1865.  The church was further altered in 1870.</p>
<p>The place name means 'Monastery wood/clearing', from the Old English mynster meaning a monastery, the church of a monastery or religious body, a church served by secular clergy and leah meaning a forest, wood, glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow.</p>

<p>The church is essentially Norman, but the exterior has been rendered and so covering the original stone work.</p>
<p>The tower was added in 1835, and the church was restored by the Victorians.</p>
<p>The decoration around the south window of the chancel has been considered to be 12th Century, but it may be 19th Century.</p>
<p>The monk prefix of the name of the settlement means the farm or settlement was a possession of Wenlock Priory.  Hop is the Old English for a remote enclosed space; a piece of enclosed land in a fen; an enclosure in marsh or moor (in this case an escarpment valley south of Much Wenlock).  Tun is the Old English for an enclosure; a farmstead; a village; an estate.</p>

<p>The present building comprises the medieval tower (13th Century), a 17th Century north transept and an early Victorian nave and chancel (rebuilt in 1845).</p>
<p>Inside the box pews and the hammer beam roof are Victorian.  The west gallery is supported by cast-iron pillars.  Near the font is some Roman mosaic, thought to have been brought from a grand tour rather than being taken from a nearby Roman settlement.</p>
<p>The north transept was built as the More family mortuary chapel.  There is a connection between the More family and the Mayflower (1620) - citation needed.</p>
<p>The church formerly housed an important library of early theological books which were given to the parish by Richard More in 1680 (his intent was to teach the minister sound doctrine), the books are now at the nearby Linley Hall.</p>
<p>In Old English 'mor' is a marsh or barren upland, from which the settlement takes its name.</p>

<p>The origin of the name of the settlement is uncertain, the generic is 'open land'. Both a river-name and a hill-name, the latter derived from Celtic mamm, 'hill', has been suggested, but there is as yet no satisfactory etymology for this name.</p>

<p>The first church on this site was Anglo-Saxon, built probably about AD 680.  The present church was built by the Cluniac monks of Wenlock Priory.  The church was extended in 1844 when a new aisle was added and the church refurbished.</p>
<p>There is a monument to William Penny Brookes (known as the founder of the modern Olympic Games).</p>
<p>Above the south porch is a 14th Century parvise, or small chamber used as living quarters by the parish priest.</p>
<p>The tub font is thought to be 12th Century.  The pulpit is Jacobean.</p>
<p>The name Wenlock is thought to be 'white enclosed place'.  The white probably refers to the limestone escarpment of Wenlock Edge.</p>
<p>'Winn' is primitive Welsh for white, and 'loca' is Old English for an enclosure.  'Much' derives from the Latin 'magna' for big or great.</p>

<p>The church may even date back to before the 12th Century.  It is thought to be unique not just within Shropshire, but in the whole of England, in that it has not been the subject of Victorian restoration or alteration.  It is a simple and plain country church.</p>
<p>The church has two bells, one is 15th Century, and the other is from 1150, making it one of the oldest bells listed in the National Bell Register.</p>
<p>Some of the roof timbers have been identified as being from trees felled between 1225 and 1250, which makes them some of the oldest in situ church roof timbers.  The original roof was replaced after about 100 years, the timbers in the replacement roof are from trees felled between 1326 and 1348.</p>
<p>The name Myndtown literally means place or town by the mynd (mountain).  Myndtown was once a significant medieval village.  The village is recorded as 'Munete' in the Domesday book.</p>

<p>The original church was built circa 1200, the tower dates from the late 13th Century / early 14th Century.  The church was substantially rebuilt from 1879 to 1893 (nave 1879-80, chancel 1892-3 and spire 1880).</p>
<p>The tower has a very distinctive batter (a receding or inward slope) and very thick walls - indicating a degree of defensibility.</p>
<p>Until 1894 Norbury was a dependent chapelry of Lydbury North.  Also, records from 1521 indicate that the church was dedicated to St Ethelbert.</p>
<p>The chancel screen is late 19th Century and has a built-in pulpit.  The octagonal font is possibly early 14th Century (one side of which is ornamented with a rosette inside a circle) and retains its original square stem and raised circular plinth.</p>
<p>The east window is late 19th Century and there is a 17th Century oak chest and 18th Century coat of arms in the tower.</p>
<p>The yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be circa 2,700 years old, the tree has a girth of approx. 33ft.</p>
<p>The name of the village derives from the Old English for northern (nord) and fortified place (burh).  There are hill fort defences near the church.</p>

<p>The church was first recorded in 1254, but it is likely the tower is older as pictures of the original tower show distinct Norman features.  During the middles ages, the church was a collegiate church serving the surrounding area.  Unusually the church was staffed by three portioners, one was a dean, the first was responsible for the first 26 services in the year and the other two the next two lots of 13 each.  This arrangement persisted until 1909.</p>
<p>Before 1825 the medieval Church consisted of a chancel, nave, north and south aisles and a northern tower.  In 1772 concerns were raised over the stability of the church and in 1810-11 local architects examined the church.  Soon after this the tower collapsed and in 1825 what remained of the nave and aisles were taken down.  The new rebuilt church was opened in 1829, retaining the medieval chancel.</p>
<p>In 1897 the body of the church was restored.</p>
<p>The churchyard is circular which usually indicates a very ancient site and there are several large yew trees.</p>
<p>The font is Norman.  Also of interest is the aumbry door which is dated 1652.</p>
<p>There was known to be a clock in the tower in 1788.  The present clock was made in Whitchurch by J B Joyce, and was installed in 1858.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means 'Pant's fortification' (an old English personal name and burh) but may be, 'River Pant fortification', an old name for the tributary of the River Rea that passes nearby.</p>

<h3>Quatford - St Mary Magdalene</h3>
<p><b>Grade: II*</b></p>
<table><tr><td>
<img class="imgr" src="assets/images/churches/2022-06-11_14_21_58_DSC_2610.jpg" alt="" align="left">
<p>Roger de Montgomery (the first Earl of Shrewsbury who owned most of Shropshire) established the first church (and a castle) at Quatford in 1086 AD, but it wasn't long before Bridgnorth was settled upon as a better location.  De Montgomery's first wife was murdered, his second wife Adeliza de Pusey had to travel from France.  While she was sailing across the English Channel, the priest on board dreamed that if Adeliza survived the journey she should vow to build a church in honour of the Blessed Mary Magdalene at the place where she would first meet her husband.  This is the legend of how Quatford was chosen as the site of this church.  Roger and Adeliza met in 1083 or 1084, the church was completed in 1086 and was richly endowed by de Montgomery.</p>
<p>The original church was completely rebuilt in the 12th Century.</p>
<p>The church is notably built of tufa - a type of limestone in which the rock is formed by spring-water laden with calcium carbonate bubbling through spagnum moss.  The use of tufa is an indication of a relatively early Norman building, as it was not much used after c. 1150 (but the church may be an exception).  The tufa walls stood unaided for 500 years, but by the 17th Century sandstone buttresses were added.</p>
<p>The nave and tower were rebuilt in 1714.  The porch was added in 1857.  Inside, the most notable feature is the tufaceous arch - this is a rare structure.  There are some medieval tiles.  The pulpit is a good Victorian example.  The royal coat of arms is George III.  The font is unusual, the bowl is likely Norman, but the carving could have been added later.  The clock was installed in 1901.</p>
<p>In the Sanctuary are the remains of some medieval wall painting.  Also in the Sanctuary is a squint.  The piscina dates from the Decorated period.  The altar, pew ends some panelling contain fragments of a Perpendicular rood screen.  There is one original window, the rest were inserted in the 14th Century.</p>
<p>The significance and origin of the place name Quat is unclear, but ford relates to a ford.  It could be derived from Coed (the Old English for forest) or from Cwead (the Old English for mud), but more likley Cwat was a person's name.</p>

<p>The church is one the few mentioned in the Domesday book.</p>
<p>The settlement, known as Stantone at the time of Domesday book, was a prosperous place.  It was part Robert de Lacy's land and was held by Siward (an important Earl of northern England in the 11th Century).  Consequently, Stantone had a substantial Saxon church.</p>
<p>The present building retains some elements of the original Saxon church, and the church was added to in the 13th Century (when the chancel was enlarged) and the 14th Century (when the tower and south transept and aisle were added).</p>
<p>On the exterior walls are thin pilaster strips (also known as leseners), these are typical of Anglo- Saxon work - the walls between these strips were originally covered by a layer of plaster, but this had been deliberately removed by 1846.  The original Saxon doorway is still present in the north wall.  There are also two sets of canopied tomb recesses in the exterior walls.</p>
<p>The font dates from the 14th Century.  The stained glass is Victorian.  The organ was installed in 1854 and the pulpit was installed in 1849.</p>
<p>The Altar and Reredos were installed in 1849, and were originally unpainted.  They are of Caen stone (from north-western France) and were painted in 1930.  The Sanctuary floor is tiled with Ironbridge (Jackfield?) encaustic tiles, with designs by Minton.</p>
<p>There is an odd feature in the north wall of the nave, its exact purpose is unknown but it was thought to be an Aumbry (a cupboard in the wall, usually in the Sanctuary for holding the Sacraments).  The carved oak is a recent addition (a similar serpent design can be found in Worcester Cathedral).</p>
<p>The name Stanton means stone farm/settlement (stan is the Old English for a stone or rock) and tun is the Old English for an enclosure, a farmstead, a village or an estate.  Lacy is a family name.</p>

<p>In the Domesday Book, the place is called Stantune, the same as Holdgate.  Stanton Long is likely to have separated from the neighbouring parish of Holdgate some time in the 12th Century.  Alterations later in the 13th Century and the beginning of the 14th Century included new windows in the nave, partly to light a new side chapel, and rebuilding the south chancel wall, which incorporates a piscina and tomb recess.</p>
<p>The roof is late medieval.  The belfry and porch were added in the 16th or 17th Century.  The church was partly restored in 1842, and further restoration was done in 1869 to 1871.</p>
<p>The south porch has some ancient timbers at the entrance, and the side walls are Victorian.  The south door is dated circa 1200.  The chancel arch is Victorian.  There are two piscinae, one in the chancel and one in the south wall of the nave.</p>
<p>The stone reredos is unusual, constructed in 1888 and designed by F R Kempson of Hereford.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement derives from the Old English for a stone or rock (stan) and a farmstead or village (tun) and long or tall (lang).</p>

<p>Stapleton is an ancient manor recorded in the Domesday book as Hundeslit (from the personal name Hund and the Old English for hill-side.  The present name is derived from steep-place farm/settlement (stepel and tun).</p>
<p>The present church was built in the 12th Century and for reasons unknown it was originally a two storey building, a possibly unique feature amongst churches.  The second storey was built on top of the very thick walls of a Saxon or Early Norman church.  The church was on the upper floor and the ground floor is assumed to have been an undercroft (no trace now remains of the undercroft (removed in 1786)).  At one period the local population was protected from the Welsh on the ground floor. At another the congregation worshipped on the 1st floor level which has since been removed.</p>
<p>The church was probably originally a dependent chapelry of Condover.</p>
<p>The rectangular recess high up on the south wall is probably a medieval piscina and presumably served the upper level of the church.</p>
<p>The tower was added in 1832, it is unknown when the two storey were converted into one - the result is a tall church with two tiers of windows.</p>
<p>The church organ is among the top six hundred in the country and there is a small tapestry piece in the nave said to have been worked by Mary, Queen of Scots.  The altar is flanked by two tall painted German candlesticks (c. 1500).</p>

<p>The church dates back to the 13th Century, but likely has Saxon origins.  This is one of nine churches connected with Wenlock Abbey.  It is noted for its handsome ceiling and rare water leaf decoration.</p>
<p>The church was added to in the 15th Century and has late 17th Century alterations, it was restored 1859 and 1911.</p>
<p>The font is a 12th Century fluted bowl set on a 20th Century stepped plinth.</p>
<p>The east window glass is by Evans and Son of Shrewsbury.  There is 17th Century panelling set around the altar.  The early 13th Century chancel arch is of 2 orders with simple cavetto-moulded abacus, capitals of broad flat-leafed decoration much restored, and chamfered shafts.</p>
<p>The nave has a 5-bay chamfered double trenched-purlin roof with a diagonally-set ridge, chamfered straight wind braces at both purlins with inverted additional bracing at lower purlin.  One collar is dated 1707 between inscribed initials.</p>
<p>There are vestiges of painted medieval wall plaster above chancel arch.</p>
<p>On the west wall of the porch is its oldest monument, the simple medieval grave stone showing an encircled cross.</p>
<p>The name of the village is derived from the Old English 'stoc' meaning a place or secondary settlement and the saint to which the church is dedicated (St Milburga).  The village was known in Saxon times as Godstoke.</p>

<p>The church was built by Josiah Griffiths of Quatford, replacing a medieval church that is said to have been timber-framed with thatch roof (in medieval times it was a chapelry of Morville).  It was built mostly at the expense of the incumbent, the Rev William Moore.  Some furnishings were salvaged from the old church and installed in the new, including the font, pulpit (Jacobean), screen fragments (late 15th or early 16th Century), Royal Arms and a wall monument.</p>
<p>The church is an economical and characteristic example of the simple Gothic style favoured in Anglican churches before the ecclesiological revival of the mid-19th Century - a typical Commissioner’s Church built in the Early English style (a church built with money voted by Parliament as a result of the Church Building Acts of 1818 and 1824).</p>
<p>The principal memorial of interest is a neo-classical marble wall tablet to Rowland Hill (d 1780), by Truman of Bewdley.</p>
<p>The origin of the name of settlement is unclear, leah is the Old English for a wood or clearing, but the first half is unknown, 'Teasel' has been suggested, but this has been disputed on the grounds that it does not suit the available spellings.</p>

<p>The original church was Norman and there are a few surviving elements of this church in the present building.  The advowson (the right of presentation of a candidate to a benefice or church office) of the church was presented to the Abbey of Shrewsbury as early as 1095.  Much of the church was rebuilt in 1886.</p>
<p>The church has a notable tombstone (the so called Hurricane Tombstone) inside by the font under the tower, it commemorates a hurricane and snow storm which claimed the lives of seven villagers from the nearby hamlet of Asterton in 1772.</p>
<p>In the Domesday book, Wentnor is listed as Wantenovre.  The name of the village means Wonta's or Wenta's (personal name) flat-topped ridge (Old English ofer).</p>

<p>The medieval chancel was pulled down in 1753 and rebuilt.  The tower was also rebuilt at this time as the previous tower collapsed in 1753.  The church is noted for its roof structure in the aisle and nave, said to be the oldest roof of its type in the country, dendrochronolgy dates the timbers to 1342.  It is the trussed rafters and the collar-beams on the arched braces that make this roof special.  A grant from English Heritage has paid for substantial repairs.</p>
<p>The name of the village derives from the Old English west and burh meaning a fortified place, i.e. a fortified place in the west.  It was an outpost of Wroxeter Roman City, also close to Caus Castle which was a border stronghold.</p>

<p>The church is unusual in that it one of the small number of cruciform churches in Shropshire.  The original 12th Century tower finished at the belfry level, where there are lancet windows.  The most notable feature of the exterior is the door in the south of the chancel, which is late Norman.</p>
<p>The font could be as old as the church, but it is difficult to date.</p>
<p>The nave roof is said to date from 1630.  The four arches supporting the tower are pointed and may date from the 14th Century, when the tower was added.</p>
<p>The roof over the transept os of the trussed-rather type and was dated by Cranage to circa 1200 - dendrochronology now gives a date range from 1192 to 1226!  This is Shropshire's earliest dendrochronological date for any building.</p>
<p>There are two stained glass windows by Margaret Rope and her cousin.</p>
<p>The lock on the door is dated 1696.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement means the holy place (stow in Old English) of St Wistan - St Wistan was the grandson and heir of the king of Mercia, tradition has it that he was murdered (circa 849-850 AD) in Wistanstow by his cousin because he refused to accept the crown.  However, it is more likely that the Shropshire name marks the site of a hermitage associated with the saint and that the murder actually took place in Wistow, Leicestershire.</p>

<h3>Worfield - St Peter</h3>
<p><b>Grade: II*</b></p>

<img class="imgr" src="assets/images/churches/2023-01-14_16_40_17_DSC_7325.jpg" alt="" align="left">
<p>The church is thought to have been founded by Mercian Earl Leofric (husband to Lady Godiva) in Saxon Times.  The area had many caves and wells (1) which were imprtant spiritually to Pagan Saxons, and so was a good place for a new Christian church.</p>
<p>The oldest part of the existing building is 12th Century (1150-1250 AD), extensions were added between 1250 and 1499 (including the tower and spire).</p>
<p>Parts of the window at the East end of the South aisle date back to the 15th Century and it depicts, in the centre, the Crucifixion, on the left, the central figure is thought to be Bishop Scrope of Lichfield, and on the right, King Richard II.</p>
<p>The large gallery to house the organ was built in 1820.</p>
<p>Between 1861 and 1862 extensive restoration was carried out by F &amp; H Francis, this drastically altered the church and included: 1) rplacement of all windows except the East window of the South aisle, 2) the tracery of some of the windows was renewed, 3) galleries and plaster ceilings were removed, 4) the box pews were removed and replaced by the present oak pews, 5) a three decker pulpit was removed and replaced, 6) the porch was replaced, 7) the altar area was extended.</p>
<p>The tower is 80 feet high and built in red sandstone.  The spire adds another 120 feet to the overall height.  The original clappers which are around 300 years old are hanging on the wall outside the Vestry.  There are six bells dating from 1699.</p>
<p>A pair of medieval doors were found some years ago which are believed to be the old church doors and date back to the 13th Century.  They show a very early example of “ironwork,” where iron replaced skin as a method of decoration, and there are believed to be only a handful of this type of door left in England.  They are now hung on the wall of the gallery.</p>
<p>There is fine example of an alabaster monument to Sir George Bromley (died 1589 and who served as Member of Parliament for Much Wenlock, Liskeard and Shropshire).</p>
<p>The tomb with its elaborate canopy is in memory of Sir Edward Bromley (second son of Sir George Bromley), who died in 1626 and was a distinguished lawyer.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement literaly means 'River Worfe open land' - the river name is of unknown origin and feld is Old English for open country, unencumbered ground (eg. land without trees as opposed to forest, level ground as opposed to hills, land without buildings); arable land (from late tenth century).</p>
<ol>
<li>Wells were believed to have magical powers &amp; history books refer to St Peters well in Worfield. The exact location of the well is uncertain, with two sites, one in the Churchyard to the west of the Church and one on the west side of the road 150 metres north of the Church, being put forward as possibilities.</li>

<p>Although not recorded in the Domesday Book, the church is of pre-Conquest origin and the large size of the parish suggests that it may have been a minster.</p>
<p>The tower is unusally to the north of the nave.  The walls are 5ft thick at the base, it was likely a place of refuge in the early Middle Ages.  The lower part is Norman, the upper stages are Perpendicular and the parapet is 18th Century.  The buttresses were added probably in the 17th Century.</p>
<p>The porch dates from the 17th Century.</p>
<p>The chancel is Georgian (dating from 1761).</p>
<p>The collection of pews is considered to be the finest assemby of ancient pews in shropshire.  The box pews are Jacobean and the plain benches are possibly medieval.  One of the box pews has a family coat of arms (Kynnaston).</p>
<p>The nave is wide (33ft), it is possible ithe church had wooden arcades at some time.</p>
<p>The stained glass is late 19th and 20th Century.</p>
<p>The monument is to Dr. Daniel Price, rector, Dean of Hereford and Chaplain to Charles I, died 1631 but dated 1633.</p>
<p>The church was restored in 1846-47.</p>
<p>The nave roof is notable, it is 14th Century and of upper cruck construction in seven bays.  It was restored in 1924 when the 18th Century plaster ceil was removed.</p>
<p>The name of the settlement is from the Old English wordign meaning an enclosure.</p>
