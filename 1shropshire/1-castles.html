<h3>Acton Burnell Castle</h3>
<img class="imgc" src="assets/images/castles/2018-06-11_15_15_17_DSC_2621.jpg">
<ul>
<li>Date: 1284 AD</li>
</ul>
<p>Built in 1284 by Richard Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, Acton Burnell Castle is a fortified manor house three storeys high which comprised hall, solar, bedrooms, offices, chapel and kitchen. A benefit only extended to trusted people, Burnell as a friend and advisor to King Edward I, was granted a royal licence to crenellate and fortify the manor.</p>
<p>In the Autumn of 1283, it is believed that Edward I held a Parliament at Acton Burnell - this is significant because it was the first time in English history that the law making process included the Commons. The law passed became known as the Statute of Acton Burnell, a law giving protection to creditors, indicating the increasing significance of traders during those times.</p>

<h3>Alberbury Castle</h3>
<img class="imgc" src="assets/images/castles/2021-04-17_15_00_45_DSC_9443.jpg">
<ul>
<li>Date: 13th Century AD</li>
</ul>
<p>The origins of the castle are uncertain but it was probably built in the 13th century by Fulk FitzWarin (a prominent representative of a marcher family associated especially with estates in Shropshire) during the reign of Richard I.</p>
<p>The main purpose of its construction appears to have been as a barrier to stop the Welsh onslaught and to retain control of the passes along the river Severn.</p>
<p>It is thought that the castle was razed by Llewellyn the Great in 1223, only to be rebuilt three years later in 1226, this time with a stone wall surrounding the bailey. A few years later the Sheriff of Shropshire ejected Fulk FitzWarin from the castle and took over his lands citing FitzWarin's utterances he made as a renunciation of fealty. However, Fitzwarin was able to retake his lands and his manor through the law. The FitzWarin family retained possession of the castle, although they moved their seat of power to Whittington after they secured it as a stronghold, until the mid fourteenth century, when it may have been abandoned.</p>

<h3>Bridgnorth Castle</h3>

<ul>
<li>Date: 1101 AD</li>
</ul>
<p>Founded in 1101 by Robert de Belleme (the second Earl of Shrewsbury, succeeding after his father Roger de Montgomery).</p>
<p>The main feature of the castle is the great square tower, built during the reign of Henry II.</p>
<p>During the English Civil War, Bridgnorth was one of the Midlands' main Royalist strongholds. But following a three week siege Cromwell's Roundheads took Bridgnorth - Cromwell ordered that the castle be demolished and by 1647 little of the structure remained. As a result, the remaining parts of the great tower now lean at an angle of 15 degrees (four times the lean of the tower at Pisa).</p>

<h3>Clun Castle</h3>

<ul>
<li>Date: 12th Century AD</li>
</ul>
<p>Established by Robert de Say after the Norman invasion, Clun Castle was an important Marcher lord castle in the 12th Century.</p>
<p>Clun played a key part in protecting the region from Welsh attack, but the family (Fitzalan) gradually abandoned it as a property in favour of their more luxurious castle at Arundel. The family converted the castle into a hunting lodge in the 14th Century, but by the 16th Century the castle was largely ruined.</p>

<p>Great Wollaston castle is a Norman motte castle (also known as Beacon Hill), it is a well preserved example of a motte castle lying at the heart of an existing village.</p>

<h3>Hopton Castle</h3>
<img class="imgc" src="assets/images/castles/2018-02-24_16_11_09_DSC_2160.jpg">
<ul>
<li>Date: 1260s AD</li>
</ul>
<p>It is believed that the castle was founded in the 12th century as a motte and bailey castle by one of the de Optons as a mesne lord of the Says of Clun Castle. The family was politically significant, Sir Walter de Opton being Sheriff of the large, adjacent counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire.</p>
<p>It is most probable that Walter de Opton (over time becoming de Hopton) built the stone castle during the Baronsâ€™ War of the 1260s. The bailey was fortified in stone and the rectangular two-storey keep was built.</p>
<p>The last Walter Hopton died during the Wars of the Roses in the 15th century and the castle passed by marriage to the Corbet family of Moreton Corbet castle.</p>

<h3>Ludlow Castle</h3>

<ul>
<li>Date: 1075 AD</li>
</ul>
<p>The castle is believed to have been founded by Walter de Lacy after the Norman Conquest and was one of the first stone castles to be built in England.</p>
<p>During the 12th and 13th Centuries the castle changed hands many times. The Duke of York inherited the castle in 1425 and it was a symbol of Yorkist authority during the Wars of the Roses. Then in 1461 ownership passed to the crown.</p>
<p>The castle was chosen as the seat of the Council in the Marches of Wales and so was effectively the capital of Wales. Consequently, the castle was renovated throughout the 16th Century.</p>
<p>With the castle being besieged and taken by Parliamentary forces during the English Civil War and following the abolition of the Council in 1689 (after it had been restored following the English Civil War), the castle fell into neglect.</p>

<h3>Moreton Corbet Castle</h3>

<ul>
<li>Date: Circa 1200 AD</li>
</ul>
<p>Originally known as Moreton Toret Castle, the stone structure was constructed to replace the probable fortified structure inhabited by Anglo Saxon thegns. The name was changed to Moreton Corbet when Richard de Corbet inherited the castle in 1235.</p>
<p>The castle saw action in the English Civil War when it is known to have changed hands at least four times.</p>

<h3>Oswestry Castle</h3>

<ul>
<li>Date: 1086 AD</li>
</ul>
<p>The first reference to this castle is in 1086 - the recording of castelle Lurve in the Domesday book as being built by the then Sheriff of Shropshire in the Hundred of Meresberie.</p>
<p>No town was recorded until 1272, although the Welsh were referring to Croes Oswald in 1254.</p>
<p>The castle was fought over and changed ownership many times during the conflict between the English and the Welsh. By 1270 the castle's walls had been extended to encircle the town, but by this time the castle's military significance was in decline.</p>
<p>The castle was the scene of a parliament held by Richard II in 1398.</p>
<p>The castle was captured by Oliver Cromwell's troops in 1644, and by 1650 it had largely been demolished by the Roundheads.</p>

<p>Lying in the Welsh Marches, Ruyton Castle was built in circa 1148 and was destroyed in 1202 by the Welsh.  It was rebuilt by 1313 but was destroyed again by Owain GlyndÅµr during his rising against England beginning in 1400.  Some of the stone from the castle was used in the construction of the church, the ruins of the castle stand in the parish churchyard.</p>

</ul>
<p>Built by Roger de Montgomery as a defensive fortification for the town. The town walls (of which little now remain) surrounded the town from the castle.</p>
<p>Little of the original structure remains. The castle was extensively repaired in 1643 during the Civil War before being acquired by Sir Francis Newport in 1663. The castle was further repaired by Thomas Telford in 1780 on behalf of Sir William Pulteney.</p>

<h3>Stokesay Castle</h3>

<ul>
<li>Date: 1280s AD</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the first fortified manor houses in England, Stokesay Castle was built by Laurence of Ludlow. It was built on the site of an earlier castle, some of which still survives. Laurence of Ludlow was one of the leading wool merchants in England.</p>
<p>The gatehouse was added in 1640-1641, just before the English Civil War. At that time Stokesay was owned by William Craven, the first Earl of Craven and supporter of the king. The Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, the castle was besieged and the Royalist garrison was forced to surrender. The castle was ordered to be slighted by Parliament, but only minor damage was done allowing it to continue as a residence.</p>

<p>The original castle was captured and destroyed by the King of Gwynedd in 1223 - after being returned to the English under the peace treaty it was rebuilt in stone, but was then ceded to the Welsh in 1267. The castle remained in Welsh possession until 1276 when the castle became the residence of a powerful Marcher lord family.</p>
