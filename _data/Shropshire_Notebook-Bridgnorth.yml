  Title: Bridgnorth
  Description: |
    The earliest mention of Bridgnorth in historical records was in 895 when the Danes set up a camp at ‘Cwatbridge’.  In 912 Ethelfleda, the lady of Mercia and King Alfred’s daughter, built a castle at ‘Bridge’.

    

    The same year, Roger de Montgomery founded a church at Quatford dedicated to St Mary Magdalene.  Robert de Belleme, son of Roger, succeeded as Earl in 1098 and in 1101 he transferred both church and borough to a more defendable site at Bridgnorth.

    

    In 1102 Henry I besieged Bridgnorth for three months and took it from Robert de Belleme. The town then began to extend into the High Street and became a ‘Royal Peculiar’. This meant its church was not subject to a bishop’s rule, and the king became its Patron.

    

    In 1157 Bridgnorth received its first Royal charter.

    

    In 1295 Bridgnorth sent its first members to Parliament.

    

    In 1646 Bridgnorth was held for the King during the Civil War, but on 31 st March, Parliamentary forces forcibly entered the town.  On 26 April 1646 the Castle surrendered to Royalist forces and during the next year was virtually destroyed.

    

    For many centuries, Bridgnorth was an extremely busy river port. Merchandise was ferried down river in trows or barges and pulled up the river by teams of four to eight men harnessed to a tow rope. Bridgnorth’s early trades included malting, tanning, weaving, nailers, drapers and iron founders.
