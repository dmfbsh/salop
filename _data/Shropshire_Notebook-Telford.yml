  Title: Telford
  Description: |
    Dawley, now part of Telford, was designated a new town in 1963 to draw off population and industry from the city of Birmingham and the adjacent industrial region known (because of its pollution-coated landscapes) as the Black Country.  In 1968 the area of the new town was enlarged and the official name changed to Telford, and intense housing and factory development transformed the area.
