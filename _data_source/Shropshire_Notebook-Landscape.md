# Intro: The Hollies

The Hollies nature reserve (at The Stiperstones above Snailbeach).  The reserve is a scattered grove of ancient holly trees, some of the trees are 300 or 400 years old.

Rowan trees can also be seen growing next to the holly trees, in some cases the rowan trees are rooted inside the holly trees.  This is because birds such as redwings, fieldfares and winter thrushes eat the rowan berries and then deposit the seeds when perched on the holly trees.

# Intro: Titterstone Clee Hill

Titterstone Clee is third highest hill in Shropshire.  It is one of only a few hills and mountains noted on the Hereford Mappa Mundi (13th Century map of the world).

In medieval times ironstone and, later, coal were mined, in particular from bell pits (localised mine shafts), one of which is now flooded forming a lake.

The hill fort on Titterstone Clee is of note as the walls of the fort are made of stone blocks instead of earth banks.  The hill fort dates back to the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age.  It is the largest hill fort in Shropshire covering approximately 28 hectares.

The cairn near the summit of Titterstone Clee dates back up to 4,000 years (Bronze Age) and indicates that the summit of the hill was likely a ceremonial site.

The Giant's Chair near the summit of Titterstone Clee is a pile of boulders created during the cold phases of the Devensian ice age.

A number of quarries have been opened up on Titterstone Clee over the years to extract dolerite for use in road building (known locally as dhustone, dhu may have arisen from the Welsh du meaning black).  Many derelict quarry buildings are scattered over the hill and are of interest as they are very early exanples of the use of reinforced concrete for buildings.

There is an Iron Age hill fort on the summit almost 8 ha (20 acres) in size.
