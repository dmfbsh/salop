# Header: Precambrian Eon

The first of Shropshire's rocks are formed 700 to 555 million years ago, creating some of Shropshire's best known hills including the Wrekin, Caer Caradoc and the Long Mynd.  The rocks are part of the Vendian supercontinent (also know as Pannotia) and are located in the southern hemisphere, approximately 60 degrees south of the equator.

Towards the end of the Precambrian eon the supercontinent of Vendian starts to split (divided by the Iapetus Ocean), the rocks that would become Shropshire are now part of the Gondwana continent.

# Header: Cambrian Period

In the Cambrian period, Shropshire moves to 65 degrees south of the equator due to the widening of the Iapetus Ocean.

# Header: Ordovician Period

At the start of the Ordovician period, Shropshire (along with the rest of Southern Britain) formed part of the north-east margin of Gondwana.  During this period, a rift formed on the margin of the continent, creating the micro continent of Avalonia, and this new continent included Shropshire.  Avalonia starts to move northwards (at a rate of circa 2.4cm per year) as a new ocean (the Rheic Ocean) forms between Avalonia and Gondwana.

# Header: Silurian Period

The micro continent of Avalonia continued to move north during the Silurian period.  As it moved closer to the equator, the subtropial environment allowed coral reefs to grow on the northern margins of the continent, this resulted in the formation of the famous Much Wenlock limestone, circa 421 to 433 million years ago.

Perhaps the most famous rock formation in England, the Much Wenlock Limestone is known for its abundance of fossils, many of which were first recorded either in Shropshire or Worcestershire, and are found no-where else in the world.

# Header: Paleolithic Age

The Paleothic Age (or early Stone Age, circa 100,000 to 10,000 BC)...

In general, late Paleolithic people were hunter/scavengers and food gatherers. They seem to have organized themselves around (more or less temporary) natural leaders (and followers) rather than establishing a more permanent "government".

# Header: Mesolithic Age

The Mesolithic Age (or middle Stone Age, circa 10,000 to 4,000 BC) is characterised by a warmer climate that changed the arctic environment to one of pine, birch and alder forest.  The improved climate led to the continuous human occupation of Britain.  The less open landscape was less conducive to the large herds of reindeer and wild horse that had previously sustained humans.  Those animals were replaced in people's diets by pig and less social animals such as elk, red deer, roe deer and wild boar, which would have required different hunting techniques.  Tools changed to incorporate barbs which could snag the flesh of an animal, making it harder for it to escape alive.  Farming was introduced to Britain at the end of Mesolithic Age around 4,500 BC, although hunter-gather ways of life continued it was being replaced by distinct territories occupied by different groups.

By about 6500 BC, rising seas had inundated the land bridge with Europe, making Britain an island.

In Shropshire flint scrapers and other implements from this age, and made out of local pebble flint, have been found primarily in the parishes of Worfield, Claverley and Alveley, along the South East border of the county.

## The Bronze Age

Remains of Bronze Age settlements are not common in Britain and none have been recorded in Shropshire so far.  It is believed that many tribes led a nomadic lifestyle based on cattle and agriculture so did not build structures to last (communities were often based near rivers for transport).  There is evidence, however, of tree clearing at this time to make space for crops.

Tumuli (burial mounds) were built during this time on areas of high ground.  As well as providing a place to inter the cremated remains of their dead, the tumuli may also be where a tribe gathered at certain times of the year for religious purposes.  There are three known stone circles in Shropshire that date from this time at: Mitchell's Fold, Hoarstones and Whetstones (now destroyed).

# Name: Mitchell's Fold
- Date: Bronze Age

Sometimes called Medgel's Fold or Madges Pinfold, Mitchell's Fold is a Bronze Age stone circle.  Its true history is unknown.  This is one of three known stone circles in Shropshire.

# Header: c. 800 BC to 43 AD

## The Iron Age

c. 500 BC - Celts inhabit much of Europe, and begin to colonize the British Isles.

The area now known as Shropshire was part of the territory of the Celtic Cornovii tribe (they also occupied the areas now known as Cheshire, Staffordshire north Herefordshire and parts of the eastern areas of Wales - areas now known Flintshire, Powys and Wrexham).

The capital of the tribe was most probably the Wrekin hill fort.  The first mention of the tribe occurs in the works of Ptolemy in the 2nd Century AD.  The origin of the name Cornovii is unknown, but it may mean 'People of the Horn' referring to a horned god cult followed by the tribe.

# Name: Old Oswestry Hill Fort
- Date: Iron Age

One of Britain's most spectacular and impressive early Iron Age hill forts.

The complexity of the defences suggests several phases of development.  After the hill fort was abandoned it was incorporated into Wat's Dyke (built by the king of Mercia in the early 8th Century, it preceded the better-known Offa's Dyke).

# Header: 43 AD

## The Roman invasion of Britain Begins

During the Roman occupation the tribe was reorganised as a Roman civitas (a social body of the cives, or citizens, united by law) and the capital was relocated to Viroconium.

# Name: Viroconium Cornoviorum
- Date: 55 AD

The site was first established in about AD 55 as a frontier post as it was strategically located near the end of the Watling Street Roman trunk road which ran across England from Dubris (Dover).  It was the fourth largest city in Roman Britain.

The site was abandoned around 88 AD as a fortress and was taken over as a civilian settlement and continued to be inhabited until the 7th century.

The ruin is noted for the 'the Old Work' (an archway, part of the baths' frigidarium and the largest free-standing Roman ruin in Britain).

# Header: 410 to c. 450 AD

## Post-Roman Britain

In 407 the Roman troops in Britain are sent across the Channel into Gaul to defend that part of the Empire against the threats from the east. This left Britain without any protection, the Saxons took advantage and raided in 408 and 409 AD. Requests for aid were rejected by the Emperor in Rome, and so the Romano-Britains expelled the Roman officials.

Roman civic life continued, but declined (as the cities had lost their central function as centres for taxation and administration) and by about 450 AD the Roman economic system had broken down. Many of the Roman buildings at Viroconium Cornoviorum fall into disrepair and there is a substantial rebuilding programme in timber - who instigated this rebuilding is unknown, possibly a bishop.

# Header: c. 450 AD

## Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain Begins

England is subject to successive invasions of Germanic tribesmen (Angles, Saxons and Jutes). Originally settling in eastern England, they moved progressively west as more arrived.

The Cornovian tribal area is under the rule of the Kingdom of Pengwern (little is known about Pengwern and how it came about, although according to Welsh tradition it was part of the Welsh kingdom of Powys). Early Powys, much larger in extent than the later medieval kingdom, is thought to have roughly coincided with the territory of the Cornovii tribe whose civitas capital or administrative centre was Viroconium Cornoviorum.

It is possible that the area of Shrewsbury was first settled in the 5th Century by refugees from Wroxeter. Also, at this time the king of Powys may have moved his court to the same area to resist the encroaching Anglian advances.

Wroxeter’s abandonment as a settlement cannot be precisely dated, however, but may have occurred in the mid sixth century, when a 'Great Plague' is known to have swept through Britain, or possibly in the seventh century, when the Anglo-Saxons took control of the region.

# Name: Battle of Maserfield, Oswestry
- Date: 641 AD or 642 AD

The Battle of Maserfield (or Maserfeld, "marsh (border) field"), was fought on 5th August 641 or 642, between the Anglo-Saxon kings Oswald of Northumbria and Penda of Mercia, ending in Oswald’s defeat, death, and dismemberment.

It is also thought that the Pengwern participated in the battle, as allies of Penda.

The battle left Penda (the Mercian king) as the most powerful king in England.
![](../1shropshire/assets/images/history/2019-06-01_13_37_32_DSC_4458.jpg)

# Header: c. 642 AD

## Integration with Mercia

Evidence of Anglo-Saxon settlement in Shropshire is rare before the 7th Century.

Following a period of military alliance with Mercian rulers, particularly King Penda, Pengwern was absorbed by neighbouring Mercia after 642 AD (and the battle of Maserfield). The local Cornovian people may have continued to reside in the area, perhaps as the Wrekensaete, under Mercian rule.

It is likely that the Cornovii territory was partitioned and ruled by different princes, probably perpetuated in the ancient boundaries between the dioceses of Lichfield and Hereford.

Eventually, the northern part of Shropshire was part of the Anglo-Saxon territory of Wreocensaete (sometimes anglicised to Wrekinsets, the name approximates to Wrekin-dwellers) and the southern part of Shropshire probably belonged to the Magonsaete (a minor sub-kingdom of the greater Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia).

The northern and southern parts of Shropshire were absorbed into the Saxon kingdom of Mercia by King Offa (Offa ruled Mercia from 757 to 796). In 765 AD he constructed Watt’s Dyke to defend his territory against the Welsh, and in 779 AD, having pushed across the River Severn, drove the Welsh King of Powys from Shrewsbury, he secured his conquests by a second defensive earthwork known as Offa’s Dyke.

The name "Mercia" is Old English for "boundary folk".

Shrewsbury was probably founded as a town in the 8th Century by the Saxon rulers of Mercia, who needed a fortified burh to control the Severn river-crossing on the road between the burhs of Hereford and Chester.

# Header: c. 7th Century AD

## Mercia converts to Christianity in the latter part of the 7th Century AD.

The first kings of Mercia were pagans, and they resisted the encroachment of Christianity longer than other kingdoms in the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy.

Mercian rulers remained resolutely pagan until the reign of Peada in 656. The first appearance of Christianity in Mercia, however, had come at least thirty years earlier, following the Battle of Cirencester of 628, when Penda incorporated the formerly West Saxon territories of Hwicce into his kingdom, but Penda remained Pagan until his death.  Penda respected the Christians and even allowed them to operate more widely in Mercia.  However, not much progress was made in converting the nobles and people of Mercia.

The diocese of Mercia was founded in 656 by Diuma (the first Bishop of Mercia).

In 669 AD, the King of Mercia, Wulfhere, had requested a new bishop, as Mercia was without one following the death of the previous incumbent, Chad was dispatched by the Archbishop.  And so, after an inconclusive start, decisive steps to Christianise Mercia were being taken; Chad was the fifth bishop to minister to the Mercians and is credited with introducing Christianity to the Mercian kingdom.  Wulfhere gave Chad land to build a monasterary at Lichfield.

However, Mercia did not survive long as an ecclesiastical entity.  From 676 AD the Archbishop adopted a policy of appointing bishops to much smaller tribal groups within the kingdoms, thus covering smaller areas—closer in size to those found in other West European countries.  Hence, a bishopric (diocese) was established at Hereford (in 676 AD - one of the oldest in England) for the Magonsæte sub-kingdom (and the existing Lichfield diocese covered Wreocansaete).

# Name: St Chad
- Date: 669 AD

Chad became Bishop of Mercia in 669 and Wulfhere, first Christian king of Mercia, gave him land to establish his see at Lichfield.  Chad was outstanding for his humility and simplicity of life.  He died of the plague on 2 March 672.

He was at once venerated as a saint and his Shrine in the Cathedral of Lichfield was a place of pilgrimage throughout the Middle Ages.

# Name: Wenlock Priory
- Date: c. 680 AD

The original Anglo-Saxon monastery was founded by the then King of Magonsaete (king Merewalh), his daughter quickly became its abbess (she was later canonised).  Wenlock Priory was the first monastery to be founded in Shropshire.

After Milburga's death circa 727 little is known of the monastery until the Norman conquest.

# Quote: County Day

Shropshire's county day is the 23rd February which is the feast day of St Milburga abbess of Wenlock Priory.

# Name: Offa's Dyke
- Date: Late 8th Century AD

In the late 8th Century, Offa's Dyke is constructed to delineate the border between Anglian Mercia and the Welsh Kingdom of Powys (it did not represent a mutually agreed boundary, rather it is believed to be a defensive earthwork or was built to demonstrate the power and intent of the Mercians).

# Header: 878 AD

## Danelaw is Established

The Vikings had been raiding Britain since 792 AD, but being so far west, this had little impact on Shropshire until Danelaw was established.

Danelaw is established in 878 AD which divides Britain into the Anglo-Saxon south and the Danish north.

Although not part of the Danelaw, the area that is now known as Shropshire was regularly overrun by Danish raiders in the 9th and 10th Centuries, as the eastern part of Mercia had been seized by the Danes. In 874 the Danes destroyed the famous priory of Wenlock.

# Header: 879 AD to 1066 AD

## The end of Mercia

The final Mercian king died in 879 AD.  From about 883 to 911 AD Mercia was ruled by a Mercian Lord under the overlorship of Wessex.  Thus, the Kingdom of Mercia appears to have lost its political independence and was ruled by the kings of Wessex.  The last reference to Mercia by name is in the annal for 1017 AD, when Eadric Streona was awarded the government of Mercia by Cnut.  The Mercians as a people are last mentioned in the annal for 1049 AD.

Mercia was mapped out into shires in the 10th century after its recovery from the Danes by Edward the Elder (King of the Anglo-Saxons).

The first mention of "Shropshire" in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle occurs under 1006 - this is when the King crossed the Thames and wintered in the area of Shropshire.

Thirteen years before the Norman Conquest, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle relates that in 1053 the Welshmen slew a great many of the English wardens at Westbury, and in that year the English king ordered that any Welshman found beyond Offa's Dyke within the English shire should have his right hand cut off.

In the Domesday Survey, Earl Godwin, Sweyn, Harold, Queen Edith, Edward the Confessor and Edwin and Morcar (these are earls, kings and queens from Wessex and Mercia) are mentioned as having held lands in the county shortly before or during the Norman Conquest.

# Header: 1066 AD

## The Norman Conquest

The Norman conquest of Britain and start of Early Middle Ages (Medieval England).

After the Norman Conquest the principal estates of Shropshire were all bestowed on Norman proprietors, pre-eminent among whom is Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury.

Many new towns are established in the period from the Norman Conquest to the mid-13th Century and are a result of deliberate plantation.

# Name: Great Wollaston Castle
- Date: Norman

Great Wollaston castle is a Norman motte castle (also known as Beacon Hill), it is a well preserved example of a motte castle lying at the heart of an existing village.
![](../1shropshire/assets/images/history/2021-04-17_13_55_52_DSC_9418.jpg)

# Name: Shrewsbury Castle
- Date: 1070 AD

Built by Roger de Montgomery as a defensive fortification for the town.  The town walls (of which little now remain) surrounded the town from castle.

Little of the original structure remains.  The castle was extensively repaired in 1643 during the Civil War before being acquired by Sir Francis Newport in 1663.  The castle was further repaired by Thomas Telford in 1780 on behalf of Sir William Pulteney.
![](../1shropshire/assets/images/history/2018-07-14_12_32_05_DSC_2787.jpg)

# Name: Roger de Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury
- Date: 1071 AD

Roger de Montgomery is appointed Earl of Shrewsbury (the first to receive this title), although some historians believe he was not actually created Earl until 1074.  De Montgomery did not fight in the initial invasion of England in 1066, but was one of William the Conqueror’s principal counsellors.

He was one of the most powerful Marcher lords.  De Montgomery was also a great patron of monasticism, he became a monk in his newly founded Abbey of Shrewsbury just before he died in 1094.
![](../1shropshire/assets/images/history/2021-10-09_10_30_02_DSC_0603.jpg)

# Name: Ludlow Castle
- Date: 1075 AD

The castle is believed to have been founded by Walter de Lacy after the Norman Conquest and was one of the first stone castles to be built in England.

During the 12th and 13th Centuries the castle changed hands many times.  The Duke of York inherited the castle in 1425 and it was a symbol of Yorkist authority during the Wars of the Roses.  Then in 1461 ownership passed to the crown.

The castle was chosen as the seat of the Council in the Marches of Wales and so was effectively the capital of Wales.  Consequently, the castle was renovated throughout the 16th Century.

With the castle being besieged and taken by Parliamentary forces during the English Civil War and following the abolition of the Council in 1689 (after it had been restored following the English Civil War), the castle fell into neglect.

# Name: Shrewsbury Abbey
- Date: 1083 AD

The Abbey was founded in 1083 as a Benedictine monastery by the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, Roger de Montgomery (who received Shropshire from William the Conqueror in 1071). It grew to be one of the most important and influential abbeys in England, and an important centre of pilgrimage.

Also known as the abbey church of St Peter and St Paul.

The abbey was one of the last to surrender (being at the end of the commissioners circuit) and was dissolved on 24th January 1540.

# Name: Oswestry Castle
- Date: 1086 AD

The first reference to this castle is in 1086 - the recording of castelle Lurve in the Domesday book as being built by the then Sheriff of Shropshire in the Hundred of Meresberie.

No town was recorded until 1272, although the Welsh were referring to Croes Oswald in 1254.

The castle was fought over and changed ownership many times during the conflict between the English and the Welsh.  By 1270 the castle's walls had been extended to encircle the town, but by this time the castle's military significance was in decline.

The castle was the scene of a parliament held by Richard II in 1398.

The castle was captured by Oliver Cromwell's troops in 1644, and by 1650 it had largely been demolished by the Roundheads.

## The Domesday book is Completed

The Domesday book is a manuscript record of the "Great Survey" of much of England and parts of Wales, which was undertaken by order of King William the Conqueror.

# Name: Wenlock Priory
- Date: Late 11th Century AD

Wenlock was re-founded by the Normans as a priory of Cluniac monks in the late 11th Century by Roger de Montgomery. In 1101 it is reputed that Milburga's relics were discovered, attracting pilgrims and prosperity to the the priory allowing the impressive medieval priory to be built (which reflects the Cluniac love of elaborate decoration).

# Header: 11th & 12th Century AD

Many churches are built in the 11th and 12th Centuries - the church was massively endowed and its role all pervasive in medieval society.

Churches are listed on a separate page.

# Name: Bridgnorth Castle
- Date: 1101 AD

Founded in 1101 by Robert de Belleme (the second Earl of Shrewsbury, succeeding after his father Roger de Montgomery).

The main feature of the castle is the great square tower, built during the reign of Henry II.

During the English Civil War, Bridgnorth was one of the Midlands' main Royalist strongholds.  But following a three week siege Cromwell's Roundheads took Bridgnorth - Cromwell ordered that the castle be demolished and by 1647 little of the structure remained.  As a result, the remaining parts of the great tower now lean at an angle of 15 degrees (four times the lean of the tower at Pisa).

# Name: Buildwas Abbey
- Date: 1135 AD

A Cistercian monastery founded by a local bishop.  Sparse at the outset, the abbey did undergo several periods of growth and increasing wealth.  The abbey was a centre of learning and had a substantial library.  In the early days it was also noted fits its discipline.  The abbey was suppressed in 1536 as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

# Name: St Winifred's Shrine
- Date: 19th September 1138 AD

Born probably between 610 and 620, Winefride resolved to dedicate her life to God by living a life of chastity and prayer.  Winefride was martyred as a teenager.  After her martyrdom, Winefride continued to live a holy life first as a hermit and then as a nun at Gwytherin, a remote place in Denbighshire.

In Shrewsbury, the abbey church was ready for consecration by 1130 but did not have any holy relics and the monks were envious of the many said to be in Wales.  The monks of Shrewsbury began negotiations to obtain the relics of St Winefride for their abbey.  With the consent of the Bishop of Bangor Herebert, the Abbot of Shrewsbury dispatched Prior Robert and another monk called Richard to Wales to obtain St Winefride's relics.  The relics of St Winefride were finally translated to the Abbey on 19th September 1138.  The shrine of Saint Winefride in Shrewsbury Abbey became a popular place of pilgrimage.  The shrine of Saint Winefride at Shrewsbury was destroyed in the reformation.  A fragment possibly of the shrine or of a reredos was recorded by the Rev. Blakeway in the early nineteenth century.

# Name: Lilleshall Abbey
- Date: 1145-1148 AD

The Abbey was founded around 1148 AD for a community of what is thought to be about 13 Augustinian canons from Dorchester Abbey in Oxfordshire.

During the 13th Century, the Abbey enjoyed great wealth and prestige - a respectable income was derived from a variety of sources, including even the tolls for the use of the Atcham Bridge.  The then king (Henry III) was entertained at the Abbey twice in about 1240 AD.

The Abbey suffered financial problems in the 14th Century (the abbott was accused of mismanagement).

The Abbey was closed in 1538, as part of the Suppression of the Monasteries.  The site then became a private dwelling until the mid-17th Century.

During the Civil War, the former Abbey buildings were severely damaged by Parliamentarian troops, at which point the site was abandoned and left to decay.

# Name: Malinslee Chapel
- Date: circa 1150 AD

Malinslee Chapel was a Norman chapel originally erected within the grounds of Malinslee Hall. The chapel was a small sandstone structure approximately 15 metres long, consisting of chancel and nave divided by a stone screen. Today, the remains of the chapel are located in the Telford Town Park.

The chapel had become a ruin by the 18th Century, probably before 1786, when Rev Williams produced a painting of the ruins. In 1909, the ruin was bought by Edward Parry, vicar of Malinslee, who proposed to restore it as a place of worship to designs by W. A. Webb, but nothing came of this. When Malinslee Hall was demolished in 1971 to make way for the new Telford Town Centre, the chapel was dismantled by the Telford Development Corporation and later re-assembled in the nearby Telford Town Park.

# Name: White Ladies Priory
- Date: 1186 AD

A priory of Augustinian canonesses who wore habits of undyed cloth.

Unusually for a monastic site, the buildings appear to be largely unaltered from the original.  The priory was never a large or wealthy house.

It was one of the first religious houses to be suppressed in 1535, after which most of the buildings were taken down and the site passed through various owners.

# Header: 12th Century AD

## The Marcher Lordships are Established

During the 12th Century the Marcher lordships emerge as almost independent states between the Welsh and English authorities.  The Marcher families were granted privileges by the English Crown which led to the exclusion of the judicial authority of the monarch and the Sheriff from their domains.

# Name: Clun Castle
- Date: 12th Century AD

Established by Robert de Say after the Norman invasion, Clun Castle was an important Marcher lord castle in the 12th Century.

Clun played a key part in protecting the region from Welsh attack, but the family (Fitzalan) gradually abandoned it as a property in favour of their more luxurious castle at Arundel.  The family converted the castle into a hunting lodge in the 14th Century, but by the 16th Century the castle was largely ruined.

# Name: Haughmond Abbey
- Date: 12th Century AD

Haughmond was an Augustinian monastery and was closely associated with the FitzAlan family (who became Earls of Arundel).

It was a successful and wealthy abbey.

The commission to dissolve the abbey was issued from Woodstock Palace on 23 August 1539 and signed by Thomas Cromwell.  A deed of surrender was drawn up on 19 September.  By 16 October, the abbot, the prior and 9 canons had signed to acknowledge Henry VIII as supreme over the Church of England.

The site was sold, some buildings were used as a private residence, others were plundered for building stone.  During the Civil War, fire further destroyed the site and it was turned over for use as a farm.

# Name: Moreton Corbet Castle
- Date: Circa 1200 AD

Originally known as Moreton Toret Castle, the stone structure was constructed to replace the probable fortified structure inhabited by Anglo Saxon thegns.  The name was changed to Moreton Corbet when Richard de Corbet inherited the castle in 1235.

The castle saw action in the English Civil War when it is known to have changed hands at least four times.
![](../1shropshire/assets/images/history/2018-09-29_15_27_31_DSC_2907.jpg)

# Name: Alberbury Castle
- Date: 13th Century AD

The origins of the castle are uncertain but it was probably built in the 13th century by Fulk FitzWarin (a prominent representative of a marcher family associated especially with estates in Shropshire) during the reign of Richard I.

The main purpose of its construction appears to have been as a barrier to stop the Welsh onslaught and to retain control of the passes along the river Severn.

It is thought that the castle was razed by Llewellyn the Great in 1223, only to be rebuilt three years later in 1226, this time with a stone wall surrounding the bailey. A few years later the Sheriff of Shropshire ejected Fulk FitzWarin from the castle and took over his lands citing FitzWarin's utterances he made as a renunciation of fealty. However, Fitzwarin was able to retake his lands and his manor through the law. The FitzWarin family retained possession of the castle, although they moved their seat of power to Whittington after they secured it as a stronghold, until the mid fourteenth century, when it may have been abandoned.

# Name: Whittington Castle
- Date: 13th Century AD

The original castle was captured and destroyed by the King of Gwynedd in 1223 - after being returned to the English under the peace treaty it was rebuilt in stone, but was then ceded to the Welsh in 1267.  The castle remained in Welsh possession until 1276 when the castle became the residence of a powerful Marcher lord family.

# Name: Infirmary, Tong
- Date: mid-13th Century AD

The infirmary was constructed by the then owner of Tong castle as part remedy for a fine imposed on his father who rebelled against King John.  When the church and college was built in the 15th Century, the infirmary was incorporated into the college and enabled 13 alms people to be housed and looked after by the college priests.  After the Dissolution the infirmary remained as an Alms House, they were later demolished in 1764.

# Name: Ashfield Hall, Much Wenlock
- Date: 13th Century

Ashfield Hall is an historic house, consisting of two distinct portions. The left-hand side is the original 15th Century structure of coursed stone rubble with stone dressings, and the right-hand of timber frame and plaster was added late in the 16th Century.

The site was originally the site of St John's hospital, founded in the 13th Century for 'lost and naked beggars'.  The building was occupied in the 15th Century as the private house of the Ashfield family.  Later it was called the Blue Bridge Inn from the bridge over a stream that ran in front.  Charles I is believed to have stayed here in 1642 on his way from Shrewsbury to Oxford.

# Name: Hopton Castle
- Date: 1260s AD

It is believed that the castle was founded in the 12th century as a motte and bailey castle by one of the de Optons as a mesne lord of the Says of Clun Castle.  The family was politically significant, Sir Walter de Opton being Sheriff of the large, adjacent counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire.

It is most probable that Walter de Opton (over time becoming de Hopton) built the stone castle during the Barons' War of the 1260s.  The bailey was fortified in stone and the rectangular two-storey keep was built.

The last Walter Hopton died during the Wars of the Roses in the 15th century and the castle passed by marriage to the Corbet family of Moreton Corbet castle.

# Name: Cruck Cottage, Upton Magna
- Date: 1269 AD

This cottage is thought to be the oldest still-standing cruck cottage in England (and one of the oldest still-standing cruck cottages in Europe).  The Historic England listing suggests that the cottage dates from the 15th or 16th Century (and building does appear to have been remodelled in the 15th century), but dendrochronological tests on the crucks in the cottage have dated the timber to 1269.

# Name: Acton Burnell Castle
- Date: 1284 AD

Built in 1284 by Richard Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, Acton Burnell Castle is a fortified manor house three storeys high which comprised hall, solar, bedrooms, offices, chapel and kitchen.  A benefit only extended to trusted people, Burnell as a friend and advisor to King Edward I, was granted a royal licence to crenellate and fortify the manor.

In the Autumn of 1283, it is believed that Edward I held a Parliament at Acton Burnell - this is significant because it was the first time in English history that the law making process included the Commons.  The law passed became known as the Statute of Acton Burnell, a law giving protection to creditors, indicating the increasing significance of traders during those times.

# Name: Stokesay Castle
- Date: 1280s AD

One of the first fortified manor houses in England, Stokesay Castle was built by Laurence of Ludlow.  It was built on the site of an earlier castle, some of which still survives.  Laurence of Ludlow was one of the leading wool merchants in England.

The gatehouse was added in 1640-1641, just before the English Civil War.  At that time Stokesay was owned by William Craven, the first Earl of Craven and supporter of the king.  The Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, the castle was besieged and the Royalist garrison was forced to surrender.  The castle was ordered to be slighted by Parliament, but only minor damage was done allowing it to continue as a residence.

# Name: Thomas 'Old Tom' Parr Born
- Date: 1483 AD

Thomas Parr was born at the Glyn in the township of Winnington within the chapelry of Great Wollaston (in the parish of Alberbury) in 1483.

According to the plaque he lived in the reigns of ten Kings and Queens of England and died on the 13th November 1635, aged 152 years and 9 months.  He is buried in Westminster Abbey.

A modern interpretation of the results of the autopsy suggests that Parr was probably less than 70 years of age.  It is possible that Parr's records were confused with those of his grandfather.

The brass plaque is in the church at Great Wollaston.

# Name: Lavington's Hole, Bridgnorth
- Date: 1646 AD

On 31st March 1646 during the Civil War, Bridgnorth was under siege from Parliamentary forces - the Royalists retreated to the castle after setting fire to the stables in Listley Street.  The fire soon spread to burn down many buildings in High Town.  It was the incendiary torches fired from the castle that ignited St. Leonards Church, burning all the town records that were stored in the church.  By 1st April 1646 most of Bridgnorth High Town was destroyed by the great fire.

After three weeks of continued attack on the castle Colonel Lavington took charge of getting a team of Parliamentary forces to dig a 70 foot tunnel under Castle Hill.  Knowing that the Royalists stored their gunpowder in St Marys Church, his aim was to blow up the church.

69 feet of tunnel was dug into the rock face but was not completed as the Royalists surrendered on Sunday 26th April 1646.

# Name: John Benbow Born
- Date: 10th March 1653 AD

Benbow joined the navy aged 25 years, seeing action against Algerian pirates before leaving and joining the merchant navy where he traded until the Glorious Revolution of 1688, whereupon he returned to the Royal Navy and was commissioned. Benbow fought against France during the Nine Years War, serving on and later commanding several vessels. He went on to achieve fame during campaigns against pirates and fighting in the West Indies against France during the War of the Spanish Succession.

Benbow's fame and success earned him both public notoriety and a promotion to admiral.  He was then involved in an incident during the action of August 1702, where a number of his captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did not live to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture, including Treasure Island - the Admiral Benbow is the tavern where Jim Hawkins and his mother live.

A part glazed door opens into the tree house to reveal a carved moulded cornice ceiling, stripped oak floor and gothic windows on all sides.  There is evidence that the restoration in 1760 may have been the work of the Shropshire architect Thomas Farnolls Pritchard.

Queen Victoria recorded in her diary that she watched a visiting pack of foxhounds from the treehouse during her visit to Pitchford Hall as a young princess.

# Name: English Bridge, Shrewsbury
- Date: 1774 AD

A bridge is known to have stood at this spot since at least Norman times.  A bridge known as the "stone bridge" was completed in 1774.  The central arch of this bridge was built high to provide headroom for watercraft, but this resulted in steep arches.

A new design for the bridge was put forward in 1921, the intention being to widen the bridge and reduce its height.  The new bridge re-used the original masonry, as well as some new stonework.

# Name: Shrewsbury Prison
- Date: 1793 AD

The original building was constructed by Thomas Telford to plans by a Shrewsbury architect.  The gatehouse is one of the few original features remaining, as in 1877 the prison was handed to the control of central governance and much of the prison was modernised and reconstructed as a result.

The name The Dana is still often used for the prison - the Dana Gaol was a medieval prison close to the site of the current establishment.

The bust of prison reformer John Howard is above the main entrance to the prison (Howard consulted on the construction of the prison).

The prison is famous for the high number of hangings that took place on its grounds - these took place from 1795 (the crime - theft of 10 handkerchiefs) to 1961 (the crime - robbery and murder).

It was particularly for use by his workforce, but it was also used by visitors to the area.  It was demolished in February 1804, following the departure of Reynolds from the area a year earlier.  The rotunda was described by Joshua Gilpin (an American merchant and manufacturer who toured industrial Britain at the very end of the eighteenth century) in 1796 as a round temple of about 10 feet diameter with 'pillars of cast iron hollows' and in 1801 an unknown person refers to the rotunda as being supported by '9 iron pillars' - it was a circular structure a bit like a bandstand, inside it had revolving seat.

# Name: Canal Company, Ellesmere - Beech House
- Date: circa 1806 AD

In 1791 in Ellesmere a plan was proposed by a small group of industrialists who owned coal mines, iron mines and other works for a canal network to link the rivers Mersey and Severn. The hub was to be Ellesmere. Birch House was constructed to serve as the main office. From here Thomas Telford designed the tunnels, wharfs, moorings, locks and ‘rivers in the sky’. However the canal was never finished as intended due to the project’s rising costs and the failure to generate the expected commercial traffic.

# Name: William Penny Brookes Born
- Date: 1809 AD

William Penny Brookes was an English surgeon, magistrate, botanist, and educationalist.  He established the Olympian Class of his Wenlock Agricultural Reading Society in 1850 to inspire local people to keep fit and take part in sports competitions.  Following the 1860 games, the Olympian Class was set up as the independent Wenlock Olympian Society.

Brookes' campaign for physical education brought him into contact with Baron Pierre de Coubertin - in 1890, the young French aristocrat visited Much Wenlock and stayed with Dr Brookes at his lifelong home in Wilmore Street.  Coubertin was inspired by discussions with Brookes and a games staged for his visit - in 1894 Coubertin set up the International Olympic Committee.

Consequently, Dr Brookes is credited as a founding father of the modern Olympic Games, and one of the Olympic mascots for London 2012 was named Wenlock after the town.

# Name: Cantlop Bridge
- Date: 1813 AD

Made of cast-iron, this bridge was part of an expanding network of bridges built to improve communication and trade in Shropshire.  The design was approved by Thomas Telford.  Unlike the Iron Bridge, built by Abraham Darby, Cantlop Bridge does not follow the design of a wooden bridge, as Telford recognised the strength of iron and engineered lighter frames that required less of this material.

Cantlop Bridge is the only Telford-approved cast-iron bridge remaining in situ in Shropshire.

# Name: Bridge, Coalport
- Date: 1818 AD

The first crossing of the river at Coalport was based on timber framed arches built on stone abutments and opened in 1780.

The bridge was rebuilt in 1799, with brick, timber and cast iron parts.  By 1817 the bridge was failing again, and so the bridge was completely rebuilt in iron in 1818.

# Name: Weir Built in the Shrewsbury Loop (the Middle Severn)
- Date: 1909 AD

The River Severn was a busy route for carrying raw materials and goods.  Up to the Victorian times the river was usually deep enough for the barges.

The weir at Shrewsbury was built in 1909 to keep the water level at a depth suitable for pleasure boats around the loop.
