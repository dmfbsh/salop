# Name: Cruck Cottage, Upton Magna
- Date: 1269 AD

This cottage is thought to be the oldest still-standing cruck cottage in England (and one of the oldest still-standing cruck cottages in Europe).  The Historic England listing suggests that the cottage dates from the 15th or 16th Century (and building does appear to have been remodelled in the 15th century), but dendrochronological tests on the crucks in the cottage have dated the timber to 1269.

# Name: Ashfield Hall, Much Wenlock
- Date: 13th Century

Ashfield Hall is an historic house, consisting of two distinct portions. The left-hand side is the original 15th Century structure of coursed stone rubble with stone dressings, and the right-hand of timber frame and plaster was added late in the 16th Century.

The site was originally the site of St John's hospital, founded in the 13th Century for 'lost and naked beggars'.  The building was occupied in the 15th Century as the private house of the Ashfield family.  Later it was called the Blue Bridge Inn from the bridge over a stream that ran in front.  Charles I is believed to have stayed here in 1642 on his way from Shrewsbury to Oxford.
