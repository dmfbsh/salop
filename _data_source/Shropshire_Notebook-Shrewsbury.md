# Name: Claremont Hill

The Old Parsonage or Manse This house, built in 1689 for a Shrewsbury Draper's family stands on the site of one clearly shown on the Burleigh map of 1575, which it probably incorporates. When the new king George I gave his protection to the Unitarian Church in the High Street after its destruction in 1715, this house also became the Minister's manse until thr 1920s as well as the church's school to provide non-Trinitarian education. Charles Darwin along with his sister were pupils here in 1827 under the Reverend Augustus Chase before hew went on to the Schools, Shrewsbiry (now the library). The poet ST Coleridge, though staying with Hazlitt in Wem, was associated with the house when a candidate for the ministry here, only to be granted a pension to pursue his radical policies and philosphy by thethen patron Josiah Wedgewood, Darwin's grandfather. Religious mobs damaged the house several times during the 1700s. It received the award of the Shrewsbury Civic Society for its restiration in the early 1950s.

# Name: The Bellstone

A young Charles Darwin’s first introduction to geology was a granite boulder, called the Bellstone, situated in Morris Hall courtyard in Shrewsbury town centre.

As a child, Darwin was told this sort of stone was only found much further north in Cumbria or Scotland and there was no explanation for how it ended up in Shropshire. It was only when he studied geology at Edinburgh that Darwin learned that during the last ice age moving glaciers had transported massive rocks across the country.

Shropshire has rocks from more periods of geology than anywhere else in the world, and it was The Bellstone that inspired a young Charles Darwin. The glacial meres and scars that shaped the Shropshire landscape and deposits they left (and the Bellstone in particular) convinced Darwin that the world is much older than the popular thinking at the time.

# Name: Bear Steps

The Bear Steps area encompasses many of Shrewsbury’s most historic streets.  Historically, the area was filled with traditional traders which gave the surrounding streets many of their names; Butcher Row, Fish Street, Grope Lane.  Bear Steps itself is named for The Bear Inn Pub which sat on the corner of Fish Street and Grope Lane.  Although local legend claims the area was historically home to one of Shrewsbury’s bear pits. 

At the centre of Bear Steps sit two of Shrewsbury’s five churches; St Alkmund’s and St Julian’s. Founded in 902, St Alkmund’s Church stands at the highest point in town.  St Julian’s tower dates from the 12th century, and the present nave was designed by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard who also designed the Iron Bridge at Telford.
