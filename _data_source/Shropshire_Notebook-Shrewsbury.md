# Name: Bear Steps

The Bear Steps area encompasses many of Shrewsbury’s most historic streets.  Historically, the area was filled with traditional traders which gave the surrounding streets many of their names; Butcher Row, Fish Street, Grope Lane.  Bear Steps itself is named for The Bear Inn Pub which sat on the corner of Fish Street and Grope Lane.  Although local legend claims the area was historically home to one of Shrewsbury’s bear pits. 

At the centre of Bear Steps sit two of Shrewsbury’s five churches; St Alkmund’s and St Julian’s. Founded in 902, St Alkmund’s Church stands at the highest point in town.  St Julian’s tower dates from the 12th century, and the present nave was designed by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard who also designed the Iron Bridge at Telford.
